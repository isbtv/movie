00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:40,157
<i>Let me tell you a story about a young man called Oliver.</i>

3
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:44,574
<i>There's no singing. No dancing.
And definitely no happy ending.</i>

4
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,262
<i>But before we get to me,</i>

5
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:49,599
<i>this all started with a thief
called Tom Chitling.</i>

6
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,454
There he is!

7
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,023
Stop! Stop!

8
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:20,896
Let's go!

9
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:53,119
- Come here! Where is it?
- I don't have it.

10
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,583
<i>Growing up,
it was just me and Mum.</i>

11
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:43,038
<i>We didn't have a lot,
but we had our imagination.</i>

12
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:45,855
Where'd you take us
today, Oliver?

13
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:48,766
The beach.
And we had an ice cream.

14
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,559
Mmm, delicious.

15
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:54,461
I took us
to the circus.

16
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:57,151
Wow. Elephants.

17
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:58,975
- Thanks, Mum.
- You're welcome.

18
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,343
I'm gonna take us somewhere
even better tomorrow.

19
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,727
I can't wait.

20
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:11,007
What do you see?

21
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,670
A lady swimming.

22
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,558
What else?

23
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,535
What does Oliver see?

24
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,422
I don't understand,
Mum.

25
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:23,998
Well, I see escape.

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,903
I see a powerful woman

27
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:29,983
leaving behind a life
that wasn't meant for her.

28
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,751
And all of the flowers,
they're telling us why.

29
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:40,414
Anyone ever told you
you're a bit weird, Mum?

30
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:45,151
Has anyone ever told you
you're a bit cheeky?

31
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,847
Shh!

32
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,975
Oh. We're going
to space now, are we?

33
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,062
Yeah.

34
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:56,479
I thought we were supposed to be
doing our dreams for the future.

35
00:03:58,047 --> 00:03:59,711
I don't get it.

36
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,558
Well that's you.
And that's me.

37
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,511
And we're
in a gallery.

38
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,222
And we're looking at this painting
of you and me in a gallery

39
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,302
looking at this painting
of you and me in a gallery.

40
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,319
And it goes on
and on and on...

41
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,134
<i>But nothing
lasts forever.</i>

42
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,389
<i>Then it was just me.</i>

43
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,118
Poor lad.

44
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,638
Time to go, Oliver.

45
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,334
<i>I didn't know
anyone else.</i>

46
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:34,014
<i>I certainly didn't belong
with them.</i>

47
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,223
<i>I was better off on my own.</i>

48
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,159
Oi! Wake up.

49
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,326
Wake up,
you little rat.

50
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,502
Right. I've told you before,
and I'm not... Hey!

51
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:58,943
I'm not gonna
tell you again!

52
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:01,023
Don't you dare.

53
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,814
Sod off,
you little scrounger!

54
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:05,247
Stop sleeping
in the gallery!

55
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:07,902
<i>People don't really call
me Oliver any more. They call me...</i>

56
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:05,470
Congratulations, love.

57
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:06,910
You've won
a little yellow square.

58
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,605
You could see
I had my hands full.

59
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,014
They're not my rules.
I just enforce 'em.

60
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,422
I was right here.

61
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:12,766
You was right here
for too long.

62
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:14,463
I thought
you were gonna move in.

63
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:16,318
Do you think
I like doing this?

64
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,686
Actually, I do.
It makes me feel big in every way.

65
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,511
Could you not give
the ticket to anyone else?

66
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,270
I'm not just giving 'em
to nice people.

67
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:23,902
You look like a nice person,
so I've given one to you.

68
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,758
Please, I was literally
about to leave.

69
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,134
You should have left earlier,
shouldn't you?

70
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,830
I can't afford this ticket.

71
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,879
Well, I can't afford a 4K TV,
but I wish I could.

72
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,478
I'd like one of those.

73
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,366
Actually, I don't even know
what it is,

74
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:36,478
but I like the sound of owning it.
I wish I could have it.

75
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:38,333
- Please, sir...
- Please, please, please.

76
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:40,094
Don't tell me
your problems.

77
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,013
You're gonna get another one
in a minute. Oi!

78
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,798
Hey, stay away from that van.
That's my van, you little pig.

79
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:57,279
- Here you go, miss.
- Thank you.

80
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:06,686
Stop that lad!

81
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,654
Yo, man. The bikes!

82
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,597
Yo, likkle man!

83
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,382
Yo!

84
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:46,975
- Hey, slow up, bro.
- What?

85
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,294
Relax, man.
The cops packed it in way back.

86
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:52,671
Why are you chasing me then?

87
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:54,430
'Cause you forgot
your shopping.

88
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:58,430
Okay.

89
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:04,862
- It's you, isn't it?
- What?

90
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:06,494
Doing all this.

91
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:08,990
Come on, man,
we know that it's you.

92
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:12,222
We done the forensics
on your spray cans.

93
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,493
He's a joker, this one.
But, look, listen.

94
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,445
I am Dodge,
this is Batesy,

95
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:18,333
and together we...

96
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,294
- What about your bikes?
- Not ours, pal!

97
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:36,382
Come on!

98
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,439
Hey! Stop!

99
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,030
I said get down!

100
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,502
Come on.

101
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,741
- Cracking set of pins, love.
- Look at that.

102
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,278
What happened to him?

103
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,615
- What was that?
- Brilliant.

104
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,278
You two again.

105
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,902
Oh, come on.
We're your guardian angels.

106
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,662
Where's the other guy?

107
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,903
Come with us. We'll sort you out
with some new gear.

108
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,654
Or you could just stay here.
I mean, it's up to you.

109
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,406
We got trainers as well.

110
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:24,318
Really?

111
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,397
Come on, handsome.
Follow us.

112
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,535
- I ain't got anything worth stealing.
- Come on, mate.

113
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,190
You can't go through
life trusting no one.

114
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:38,046
Yeah, we saved
your arse once already.

115
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,742
That was
the other guy.

116
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,693
What, you mean Red?

117
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,583
Yeah.
The guy in the green jacket.

118
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,230
That's a real hero,
that one.

119
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,886
<i>Entre, s'il vous plaît.</i>

120
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,557
<i>Who's that?</i>

121
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,862
Just me and Batesy.

122
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:10,463
What size waist are you?

123
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,639
<i>I'd say he's about
a 30 regular.</i>

124
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,366
Who's that?

125
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:18,430
Oh, that is the ghost
of Dodge's grandpa.

126
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:21,791
Batesy, shut up.
I'll introduce you later.

127
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:28,541
Let's get you
some clobber first.

128
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:30,206
Uh, you do realize
I've got no money?

129
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,126
It's all right. You can owe us.

130
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:33,918
I don't like
owing people.

131
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:40,190
Go on, have 'em.
Introductory special offer.

132
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:43,229
- We can spare 'em.
- Where did you get all this?

133
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,142
- Sports Warehouse.
- Oh, I lost my favorite hat on that job.

134
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,789
Are you ever gonna stop banging
on about that hat?

135
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,742
- Huh?
- Probably not.

136
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:55,805
Have 'em. They cost us nothing,
shop's claimed insurance.

137
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:58,335
Plus, them pasty legs...

138
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,341
they're gonna give me
nightmares.

139
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,174
Oh, better give 'em a little bit
of a shake actually.

140
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,479
Better give 'em
a shake first, eh.

141
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:15,646
Hey, Fagin.

142
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:20,670
Dodge, I've told you before.

143
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:23,550
You cannot bring in green kids
off the street.

144
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:25,725
- I know, but Fa...
- No buts.

145
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:27,229
Out he goes.

146
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,174
Fagin, please.
This is Twist.

147
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,446
Extreme graffiti artist.

148
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:34,110
Reaching places
others can't reach.

149
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:36,062
Tags under moving cranes
and that.

150
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,878
Like what's his face, uh...
Banksy. Yeah.

151
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,631
Reaching places other people
can't reach, eh?

152
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,822
The problem with graffiti is,
is you can't move it.

153
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:48,543
What's the point in a painting
if it's always in the same place?

154
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,454
The higher up I put my work,
the more people can see it.

155
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,422
That's the point.
It doesn't belong to anybody.

156
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,791
An idealist, eh?

157
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,901
All property is theft.

158
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,870
In my case,
that's literally true.

159
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,517
Tell me, Mr. Idealist,

160
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,366
how's virtue treating you?

161
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,477
Is it filling your stomach?

162
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,718
Can it give you
a hug on a cold night?

163
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,078
Ideals are useless.
They're like appendix.

164
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,413
Cut 'em out.

165
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:21,565
He's fast.

166
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:23,934
He left the Old Bill for dust.

167
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:26,301
I thought maybe
we could train him up

168
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,638
seeing as
we have a vacancy.

169
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,077
I'm not a thief.

170
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,022
What, you've never stole
a sarnie from Tescos?

171
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:36,317
I don't need to. They chuck out
enough if you know where to look.

172
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,429
Oh, living the dream.

173
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,765
We all have to start somewhere,
don't we?

174
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:43,646
It wasn't so long ago that you
were stealing credit card details.

175
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,117
Uh, it's called phishing.

176
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,293
It's called surviving.

177
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,206
It's what we do
to survive.

178
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,598
- Suppose.
- Bravo.

179
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:54,974
You need a place to stay?

180
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:58,814
No. Thank you.

181
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:02,334
Cheers for the clothes.
I'll pay you back.

182
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,277
That's
a really decent copy.

183
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,126
I've seen the original tons
of times at the Tate.

184
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:13,278
No, you haven't.

185
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:22,462
I tell you what.
I'll cook tonight, Dodge.

186
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,605
What do you want,
spaghetti or beef burgers?

187
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,237
- I love the...
- Ah, nah.

188
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,709
Come on. Do me a flavor, Fag.

189
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,493
You know I'm 72% vegan.
Meat is a treat.

190
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:33,885
Doesn't matter what you eat
so long as you eat together.

191
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:37,086
Because, as I've always said,
the most important thing

192
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:39,645
is the family
that eats together...

193
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,597
...stays together.

194
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,390
Yeah. Right.

195
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,237
Oi! Mate.

196
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:56,830
I just wanted to...

197
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,710
Stand there gawping
like a fish?

198
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:02,653
If you could speak sometime
soon that'd be great

199
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,157
- 'cause I've got somewhere to go.
- I'm sorry.

200
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:06,013
I didn't realize you,
you were a...

201
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,613
And I didn't recognize you
with clothes on.

202
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,085
I just wanted to say thanks.

203
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,686
You're welcome.

204
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,245
Is that everything?

205
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,414
I'll take that as a yes.

206
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:45,597
The boy's an artist.

207
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,518
So, what do you see?

208
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,205
A loner with a cracking pair
of trainers?

209
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,566
Well, that's disappointing.
You missed the point.

210
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:58,142
Can you get up there?

211
00:16:58,173 --> 00:17:00,157
Please. If he can...

212
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:03,262
- Yeah.
- Some boys like respect.

213
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:07,517
Some boys like being
in the pecking order.

214
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:08,766
But this one...

215
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:11,836
he wants something
that he's missing.

216
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:13,310
A smartphone?

217
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:17,117
He wants love.

218
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:19,294
So let's give it
to him.

219
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,934
Glad I climbed up
this side.

220
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:57,053
Sorry!

221
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:59,199
There's no toilet
up here.

222
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,438
Love what you've done
with the place.

223
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:03,678
It's just while
I'm doing this one here.

224
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,933
Gonna offer me
a cup of tea then, or...

225
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:10,366
I could do you cream crackers
and chocolate spread.

226
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:12,030
Ooh, nutritious.

227
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,837
I thought you were
a guy, by the way.

228
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,694
That's why I was being
weird earlier.

229
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:18,941
You say
the sweetest things.

230
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,405
No, no. I wasn't...

231
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:23,870
I mean, I just...

232
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,325
- The way you move...
- Like a guy? Yeah. I get it.

233
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:31,102
- I don't mean to offend you.
- Oh, why would that offend me?

234
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,253
Just guys are more strong.

235
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,749
Not that girls aren't strong.

236
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,254
Girls are strong as well.

237
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:38,174
Just guys tend to be...
I don't know.

238
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,189
Not much of
a smooth talker, are we?

239
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,558
Best stick to climbing
I think.

240
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:46,014
How come you're so good
at climbing anyway?

241
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,445
When I was younger,
I felt safer up high.

242
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:55,198
People couldn't find me.

243
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,101
So I taught myself
to climb.

244
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:01,726
And you've been a loner
on a roof ever since?

245
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:04,157
Suits me just fine.

246
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:07,005
Well, you can't stay
up here forever.

247
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,949
Isn't there things you wanna
see, things you wanna experience?

248
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,614
Must get pretty boring.

249
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,246
I can go anywhere I want.

250
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,094
- What?
- See.

251
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:30,462
I can imagine.

252
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:33,501
Well, I'm here
in real life,

253
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,605
and I've come to invite you
to a real-life dinner.

254
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:38,205
Me and you?

255
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,557
Come to Fagin's,
tonight at 7:00.

256
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,053
And you never know,

257
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:47,679
we might just be better
company than your paintings.

258
00:20:23,614 --> 00:20:24,894
What am I doing?

259
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,589
What does Oliver see?

260
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,502
Mum?

261
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,293
Can't be by yourself forever.

262
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,684
You're late.

263
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:44,957
Is that any way to greet
your favorite supplier?

264
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,333
What happened to Tom?

265
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,733
He screwed up.
That's what happened.

266
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:56,414
My kids are not disposable.

267
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:59,006
That's exactly what they are,
my old friend.

268
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,557
No friends, no family.
No questions.

269
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,317
For complications.

270
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,892
Did you get my envelope?

271
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:22,430
What, this?

272
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:25,854
When has it ever been
that easy, eh?

273
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:28,668
I want in.

274
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,589
I know you're pulling
a job.

275
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,413
You're hitting Losberne.

276
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,524
I want a cut.

277
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:35,740
I was gonna tell you.

278
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:36,926
Of course you were.

279
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:38,685
Let me make it
easy for you.

280
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:40,062
Whatever's in there...

281
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:43,005
seems very important
to your little plan.

282
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:45,277
Question is, are we gonna do it
the easy or the hard way?

283
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:56,573
Partners.

284
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:06,013
Partners. Now...

285
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:08,829
the envelope.

286
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:11,037
I think I'll keep it.

287
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,558
Just in case
of future complications.

288
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,174
Yeah.

289
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:37,821
Took your bloody...
Oh, my giddy aunt.

290
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:40,189
What is happening
with your barnet?

291
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:42,685
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

292
00:22:42,716 --> 00:22:45,406
Come on, look, look.
Welcome, Twist.

293
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:49,758
Let me take your jean shirt,
jacket for you. There we go.

294
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,117
- Come on.
- Ah.

295
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:54,972
Glad you could make it,
mate.

296
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:57,469
Oh, Twist.
Come and sit next to me.

297
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:04,157
Oh, blimey, look. Nancy,
take his beautiful flowers

298
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:05,470
and put them in some water.

299
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:07,933
Mmm.

300
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,252
He can call me that.

301
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,565
- You don't.
- Understood.

302
00:23:13,597 --> 00:23:17,021
I am starving.

303
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:18,461
Dodge, please.

304
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,222
Fagin, can we just
talk about something?

305
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:22,430
Can we talk about our boy,
Batesy here,

306
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,285
stealing my food
from under my bed?

307
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:26,236
- Grass.
- Thief.

308
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:28,894
- Okay, we're all thieves.
- Yeah, be a better one is the point.

309
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,036
All right. Okay, okay.

310
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,310
Uh, Twist,

311
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,764
I want you to say a few words
because it's a tradition.

312
00:23:36,797 --> 00:23:39,326
About how thankful you are.

313
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:44,317
Well, thanks for having me
round for dinner, I suppose.

314
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,069
I can't remember the last time
that I sat down...

315
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,766
Like a family?

316
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:51,806
We're all orphans here.

317
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,910
All right,
that's the thanks.

318
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,573
Cool, um,
can we bloody eat now?

319
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,654
- Yes! Eat. Eat.
- All right!

320
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:04,604
- Eat.
- All right, all right.

321
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:06,398
Let's go.

322
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,902
Mmm.

323
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,526
It appears that
you're a connoisseur of beauty.

324
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:23,838
Yeah. I saw you in my office
admiring my collection, Mr. Twist.

325
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,845
Can I stop using that name?

326
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:29,213
It makes me sound
as though I'm in a casino.

327
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:31,484
What else can I call you?

328
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:33,308
Oliver.

329
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,964
Oliver. Well, Oliver,

330
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:38,300
your artwork is impressive.

331
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,998
They're just copies.

332
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,685
No, nothing is just a copy.
We always put a little bit

333
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:44,733
of soul into everything,
don't you think?

334
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,413
- Yeah, I suppose.
- When I was your age,

335
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:50,493
I wanted to be an artist,
just like you.

336
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:53,245
But my father was tasteless.
A bully.

337
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:55,006
Oh, I'm sorry.

338
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,885
Why sorry?
This is all my art, and Nancy...

339
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:00,701
is my masterpiece.

340
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:03,197
She needs someone to train with.

341
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:05,501
Someone who can keep up
with her.

342
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:10,428
- So you all just do whatever you want?
- Yes. But together.

343
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:11,900
We never work alone.

344
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:15,484
You know, we live together,
we eat together.

345
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,244
Because the family
that eats together...

346
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:19,132
Stays together. I know.

347
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:22,397
Watch this,
watch this.

348
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,214
Got a little surprise
for you.

349
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:26,749
- For me?
- Yeah.

350
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:38,109
Come on, then.

351
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:41,053
You ready?
We're going out.

352
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:43,198
Come on.

353
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:46,077
Make sure you bring him back
in one piece.

354
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:58,269
Don't you guys
ever feel bad?

355
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:01,277
What? No.

356
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,677
Look, the people that
we target are criminals anyway.

357
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,398
So, it's justified,
innit?

358
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:09,308
Think of Fagin
as good old Robin Hood

359
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,973
and we're his Merry Men.

360
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,253
Hmm.

361
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:40,478
Oliver.

362
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:42,844
Oliver.

363
00:26:42,877 --> 00:26:45,278
Hey, wake up. Come on.

364
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,606
Get changed.
We're going out.

365
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:52,093
Okay, give me a sec.

366
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,414
- So, are you sticking around?
- Yeah, I think I will.

367
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:02,269
You sure
you wanna do this?

368
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:05,085
Yeah. It's nice
to belong to something.

369
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,517
Trust me, you'll be fine.

370
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:22,429
Morning, Dr. Losberne.

371
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,885
Good morning.

372
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:32,893
Dr. Crispin Losberne.

373
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:36,861
Curator, art dealer

374
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:40,444
and connoisseur
of 18th-century painters.

375
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:43,005
He's very predictable,
which helps.

376
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:48,253
Gets up every morning and leaves
for work at eight o'clock sharp.

377
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,909
<i>He looks at his messages</i>

378
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:54,845
<i>and he puts his phone away in the
right-hand pocket of his coat.</i>

379
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,788
- Flat white.
- <i>Pays the barista.</i>

380
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,645
Then he drinks his coffee.

381
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,437
- Hmm.
- What's all this about?

382
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:03,740
Well, we're gonna borrow
his phone.

383
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:06,685
And have it back in his pocket
before he knows it's gone.

384
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:08,156
But why?

385
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:09,981
He took everything from me.

386
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:11,197
Everything.

387
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,676
And I'm going
to return the favor.

388
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:19,453
First thing, we need
to hack Losberne's phone.

389
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:22,333
Oh, and as far as the day
is concerned,

390
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:23,804
it's all performance art.

391
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:27,230
And the performance
will be given by Nancy.

392
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:30,910
Oh!

393
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,252
I am such a klutz.

394
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:34,204
Let me help.
I've got tissues in my bag.

395
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:35,710
You absolutely must
let me help.

396
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:38,109
God, it's all over
your lovely jacket.

397
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:39,550
Oh, I'm so stupid.

398
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:45,980
I was on my way
to the Royal Academy

399
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:47,485
to see
the Gainsborough exhibition.

400
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:49,213
- Really.
- Oh, have you been?

401
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,725
As a matter of fact,
I curated it.

402
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:56,573
- Really?
- Oh, yes. Come on.

403
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,814
- <i>Dodge, you got it yet?</i>
- Yeah, plugging in.

404
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:03,164
All right.
On its way, Batesy.

405
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:05,469
I'm quite a mover and shaker
in the art world.

406
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,525
I have my own place.

407
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:07,806
You have
your own gallery?

408
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:10,428
<i>That working, Bates?</i>

409
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,542
You don't ever need interns,
do you?

410
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:13,692
Never say never.

411
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,733
<i>Come on, Batesy.
Hurry up.</i>

412
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:18,397
I'll give you my card.

413
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,477
<i>I'm going as quick as I can.</i>

414
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:21,789
It's in my jacket.

415
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:22,973
Oh.

416
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,269
<i>We need
to speed this up.</i>

417
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:28,701
Yes, of course.

418
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:31,965
- Oh.
- Bit wet.

419
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:33,692
Hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

420
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,325
Pop by anytime.

421
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,038
- Goodbye.
- Dodge, quick, he's leaving.

422
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,542
Quickly!

423
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:46,462
Yes. Let's go.

424
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:55,133
Garages on Swift Road.

425
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,366
Someone's taken my phone.

426
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:21,820
Get out of my taxi!

427
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:23,902
Sorry, mate.
I thought it was free.

428
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,644
- God.
- Is that what you're looking for?

429
00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:31,870
Yes. Thank you.

430
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,268
You can keep the taxi.
I'm going to walk.

431
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,093
Cheers.

432
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:40,701
Where to, guv?

433
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,445
Not bad for your first job,
Oliver.

434
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,652
Yeah, and that was just
the hors d'oeuvre.

435
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,396
Batesy, keep hacking.

436
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:53,341
One word from Losberne,
I wanna hear it.

437
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,934
We need to know his every move.

438
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,108
- Dodge?
- Yeah?

439
00:30:58,141 --> 00:30:59,452
Do the washing up.

440
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:01,661
Oh, man.

441
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,964
Nancy, you're going
to art school.

442
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:05,469
What?

443
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,581
It's a crash course.

444
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,948
If you're gonna be convincing
as an art student

445
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:11,805
for an evening,
or even for ten minutes,

446
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,236
you're gonna have to know
some art to talk about.

447
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:17,116
Oliver, would you mind?

448
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:18,973
- Of course.
- Ah, good.

449
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,533
But nothing beats seeing
it in the flesh.

450
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:24,957
This is about
Pope Nicholas.

451
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:27,229
He's fuming.

452
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,052
And Dante's... Shit.

453
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:30,781
Wha...

454
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:32,701
Guard.

455
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,356
You do realize
this gallery's free, yeah?

456
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:37,628
He's worked here
for years. He hates me.

457
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,612
He's always throwing me out
for sleeping here.

458
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:43,421
Get up.
Here, I got you.

459
00:31:44,957 --> 00:31:46,333
He doesn't scare me.

460
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:50,781
Shall we...

461
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:01,822
Millais's a genius.

462
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:06,301
- The use of...
- Hardly gonna win the 500-meter backstroke, though, is she?

463
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,950
I'm joking.
I know it's Ophelia.

464
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,701
Anything else
you'd like to add?

465
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,060
Well, personally,

466
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,596
I think the flowers
in the painting

467
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:19,517
are as important
as Ophelia herself.

468
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:22,364
The floating flowers,
they represent her sorrow.

469
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:24,637
And the nettles growing
around the willow,

470
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:26,269
well that's...
that's her pain.

471
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,149
Exactly.

472
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,909
Did you do art
at school?

473
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,044
No. It's just
common sense, innit?

474
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,701
Well, that
and the Internet.

475
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,941
All right.
Let's see what else you got.

476
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,581
So, do you feel ready to be the most
convincing art student of all time?

477
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:54,013
Yeah. Totally.

478
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:56,124
Although no thanks
to my teacher. He was rubbish.

479
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:57,468
Oi!

480
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,222
So, uh...

481
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:03,325
couldn't help
but notice old Ophelia

482
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,085
made quite an impression
on you in there.

483
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:07,454
Yeah.

484
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:09,948
What was it about her?

485
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,581
I used to go to
that gallery with my mum.

486
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,012
She was an artist.

487
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:20,476
Right.
That makes sense.

488
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,189
- So, you did have a family?
- Just a mum.

489
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,262
She wasn't around
for too long.

490
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:30,557
Did you?

491
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:32,060
Just a dad.

492
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:33,788
But he was around
for too long.

493
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:38,621
So why did you get
into free running then?

494
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:41,406
So I could escape.

495
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:43,549
Escape from what?

496
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,708
From boys called
Oliver Twist.

497
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:54,716
Come here!

498
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,413
<i>To pull this job off, we'll
need the plans for Losberne's gallery.</i>

499
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,580
<i>Oh, not
the caterpillar tash.</i>

500
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:05,180
- Hello.
- Good morning, sir.

501
00:34:05,213 --> 00:34:06,941
We spoke on the telephone

502
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:09,917
about your conversion
of number 30.

503
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:11,388
The Losberne Gallery?

504
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:14,077
I have bought
the building opposite

505
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:18,044
and I want you to make it modern
like number 30.

506
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:20,956
I have the plans here. I can show
you what we did for Dr. Losberne.

507
00:34:20,987 --> 00:34:22,620
Follow me.

508
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:28,028
Yes. Very nice,
very nice.

509
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,061
<i>Da.</i>

510
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:35,004
11:05 on the dot, Fagin.

511
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:36,668
Just like you said.

512
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,693
This is private.

513
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:52,221
It's okay.
I don't understand Russian, so...

514
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,325
You want my business?

515
00:34:56,252 --> 00:34:58,749
Certainly.
Take your time.

516
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,188
Thank you.

517
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:13,373
No windows, reinforced walls.

518
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:15,357
That's the one.

519
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:18,044
That'll be
a job getting in.

520
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,581
We don't have to do that.

521
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:22,844
If we do
what I've got planned,

522
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:24,893
they bring it out.

523
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:26,236
Batesy, carry on.

524
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,645
Bring what out?

525
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:31,804
This is the painting
we're gonna steal.

526
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:34,973
One of six paintings
by William Hogarth.

527
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:37,693
That says Dotheboy's
Auction House, Fagin.

528
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:39,260
Why are we casing up Losberne?

529
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:41,085
The painting
was lost in a fire,

530
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:44,028
but many people believed
it was a cover-up for a theft.

531
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,229
All this time,
it's been off the radar.

532
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,981
So you're saying
Losberne's got it?

533
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:52,092
- He's the seller.
- Wait, hang about.

534
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:53,660
How did he get his hands on it?

535
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:56,733
Many years ago,
Losberne went into partnership

536
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:58,812
with a man called
Isaac Solomon.

537
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:01,244
Both of them bought
a lot of paintings.

538
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:03,644
One of them was the Hogarth.

539
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,499
But when they had it in auction,

540
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:09,244
Losberne went missing
with the paintings.

541
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:11,740
- Oh.
- And Solomon had nothing,

542
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:14,940
and his credibility
as an art dealer was gone.

543
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,973
Later, Losberne said
the paintings had been stolen.

544
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:20,380
So my man tells me.

545
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:23,805
How long have you been there?
I didn't hear you come in.

546
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,436
You should be more careful,
Fagin.

547
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:27,196
You're getting sloppy
in your old age.

548
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,573
Oh,
it's only you two.

549
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:36,029
Oliver, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

550
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:38,780
Oliver.

551
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,525
Here, boy.

552
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:44,764
This is Bullseye.

553
00:36:44,796 --> 00:36:45,852
Aw...

554
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,572
You're gonna need
your hands later.

555
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:52,028
Round two.

556
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:56,029
Magnetic, see?

557
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,204
Stick it on a pipe and get out.

558
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:10,556
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Is it a bad time?

559
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:13,212
It's the perfect time.

560
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:25,084
Thank you.

561
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,036
Bottoms up.

562
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:28,477
Oh.

563
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:30,621
Cheers.

564
00:37:36,347 --> 00:37:38,267
So, you were saying
it'd be answering the phones,

565
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,091
doing a little bit of filing?

566
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:42,460
Nothing a girl
like you couldn't handle.

567
00:37:43,037 --> 00:37:45,757
I did actually want
to show you some of my art.

568
00:37:46,492 --> 00:37:47,933
Street art, you say?

569
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:49,757
Yeah,
it's just on here.

570
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:55,132
<i>Let me just find them.</i>

571
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,373
<i>Uh, yes. Okay.</i>

572
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,325
This one is actually
based on...

573
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:01,244
William Blake.
Of course.

574
00:38:03,356 --> 00:38:05,468
I love what you've done
with the line there.

575
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,892
<i>These are actually
rather intriguing.</i>

576
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:09,980
<i>Don't gas me.</i>

577
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,956
Come on, girl.

578
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:14,173
Give her a second.

579
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,124
Sorry,
that's my graffiti talk.

580
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:18,429
It's the only way to get taken
seriously on the street.

581
00:38:19,803 --> 00:38:21,437
Oh, right.

582
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,261
Well, don't forget
your wine.

583
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:25,307
Do you know, it's just going
straight through me.

584
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,260
I must pop to
the little girls' room.

585
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:34,941
Is it downstairs, or...

586
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:37,212
Straight down
the stairs.

587
00:38:37,244 --> 00:38:38,716
The door straight
in front of you.

588
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:42,812
Okay. Thanks.

589
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:00,988
Oh, no. No, no, no.
He's on the move.

590
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:12,188
- <i>I could have blown my hand off.</i>
- Yeah, calm down.

591
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:14,460
- Everything all right?
- Yes, I'll be up in a minute.

592
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:16,317
You better have brought
a spare.

593
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:17,341
Uh...

594
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:23,037
We just gotta get it
to her.

595
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,093
I'll take it.

596
00:39:24,476 --> 00:39:25,917
I'm the climber,
right?

597
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,220
Whatever you do,
don't drop it.

598
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:02,556
Red, it's me.
Let me in.

599
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:07,869
Look out.

600
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:10,941
- Oh, my God.
- Be careful.

601
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:12,348
Okay...

602
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,764
What's going on
down there?

603
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:28,156
Losberne Gallery.

604
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:29,373
Special delivery.

605
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:31,100
At this time of night?

606
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,148
I'm right outside, mate.
Got a large package.

607
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:35,771
Says, "artworks, fragile."

608
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:38,076
I could leave it
on the doorstep if you want?

609
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:39,676
No, no, no.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

610
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,565
I was just in
the middle of something.

611
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:42,716
One second.

612
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:45,693
I'm at the window.
Where are you?

613
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:47,772
<i>Um, let me
just check on that.</i>

614
00:40:47,804 --> 00:40:49,565
Sorry, mate. Wrong number.

615
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:03,771
I wouldn't use that lav...
uh, bathroom for a bit.

616
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:07,004
I'm sorry. You're going to have
to wait here for a moment.

617
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:08,541
Brittles?

618
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:10,012
Can you come up here, please?

619
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,901
What is this?

620
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:25,628
Search her bag.

621
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:27,197
Hey!

622
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,083
Excuse me!

623
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:35,644
If that's the way
you treat all your interns,

624
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:36,924
you can take
your work experience

625
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,365
and shove it up your arse!

626
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:01,500
Okay.

627
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,252
<i>Our Dr. Losberne is gonna
get a surprise in the morning.</i>

628
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:30,427
Until then,
you can take the night off.

629
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,828
- Go out, have some fun.
- Yes!

630
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,875
Yeah, but wait a minute.
Not too much fun

631
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:37,276
because you're back
on duty at 7:00 a.m.

632
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:38,363
7:00?

633
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:40,219
We've all gotta be ready

634
00:42:40,252 --> 00:42:42,013
to move when
the phone goes.

635
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:44,028
And I'll stay tuned to Losberne.

636
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:47,228
Well, you know he might be
into some heavy phone sex,

637
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,820
which means you might be in
for a steamy night, old boy.

638
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:51,708
So there's this party.

639
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,468
- What you saying?
- Red, you coming?

640
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,940
She got plans.

641
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,668
You did good.

642
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:15,228
Mate, let's go.
Come on.

643
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:17,181
Awkward.

644
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,876
Come on, mate. Don't be such
a Debbie Downer.

645
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,468
You know, there are
other birds in London.

646
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,772
Come on.
Have a drink with us.

647
00:43:39,803 --> 00:43:42,140
No, I'm all right, mate.
Honestly.

648
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,123
Come on.
You know you want to.

649
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,404
Seriously, Batesy.

650
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:47,261
I'm all right here.

651
00:43:48,123 --> 00:43:49,659
All right. Fine.

652
00:43:58,364 --> 00:43:59,933
- Hey.
- I said...

653
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:03,228
Oi. You mug.

654
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,012
She belongs to Sikes.

655
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,900
You think
I don't know that?

656
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:09,085
I don't belong to anyone.

657
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:17,917
We'll see.

658
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,284
Oi, Batesy!
Batesy, look out!

659
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,372
I love coming here.

660
00:45:01,403 --> 00:45:03,292
You almost forget
you're in the city.

661
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:05,884
How do you know
about this place?

662
00:45:05,915 --> 00:45:08,796
Uh, Sikes brought me
here once.

663
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:11,900
Why'd you bring me
here then?

664
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:15,996
Because I wanted to.
Is that okay?

665
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,460
Hmm?

666
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,748
Red!

667
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,187
Seriously, why did
you bring me here?

668
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:42,076
Why wouldn't
I bring you here?

669
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:44,347
I don't think your girlfriend
would be too happy if she knew.

670
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:46,332
Mmm, never said
she was my girlfriend.

671
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:49,116
Why didn't you tell me?

672
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:51,132
Tell you what?

673
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:53,660
That you're only into...

674
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:56,572
Girls?
Never said that either.

675
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,667
I'm so confused.

676
00:46:14,747 --> 00:46:16,508
Oi! What the hell
are you doing?

677
00:46:28,156 --> 00:46:30,428
Hey. Don't tell anyone
about this, yeah?

678
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,884
Red, if this is about Sikes,
you don't need to be scared.

679
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,060
It's not me
I'm scared for.

680
00:46:53,404 --> 00:46:55,484
Got you!

681
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:58,076
You think you're clever, don't you?
Call the police, love.

682
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,444
- I will 'cause you're assaulting him!
- Assaulting him?

683
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:03,259
- Yeah!
- This little bellend has been vandalizing property

684
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:06,652
of the council with his
shitty little paintings.

685
00:47:06,683 --> 00:47:08,412
You wanna go as well, eh?

686
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:09,723
Come on!

687
00:47:09,754 --> 00:47:11,867
Here they are.
Get down there, you! Go on.

688
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,748
She's with the bellend there.
Arrest them.

689
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:16,603
- Stay with them. It'll be okay.
- Come on, Son.

690
00:47:17,052 --> 00:47:18,300
I'll get Fagin.
Go on.

691
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:20,028
Thank you.
All right.

692
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,660
Personally I think
it's an improvement.

693
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:32,605
So let me go.

694
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:36,347
Unfortunately,
Metropolis Parking Solutions...

695
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:38,491
That's the company
whose property you vandalized,

696
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:41,309
they don't quite share
the same views.

697
00:47:46,556 --> 00:47:48,188
Little Ollie Twister.

698
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:56,636
Look, to be honest, Oliver,
a little bit of graffiti

699
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,940
is not really
what concerns me.

700
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:01,371
You kind of running
into Warden Bumble,

701
00:48:01,404 --> 00:48:03,196
well that's just kind
of fortuitous for me.

702
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:04,604
It's like
a happy accident.

703
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,580
What I really wanna talk
to you about is...

704
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:12,764
this man.

705
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:15,164
Fagin.

706
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,947
An alias, obviously.

707
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,507
A once prestigious
art dealer.

708
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,268
Then out of the blue...

709
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,932
...vanishes.
Disappears.

710
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:27,291
And since then, it seems
like he's been putting

711
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:30,013
his knowledge of art
to more practical usage.

712
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:33,245
Apparently he's running
quite the operation.

713
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:36,829
Yeah.

714
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,579
And what about
this lovely lady?

715
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:41,116
Known associate of Fagin.

716
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:42,492
Sikes.

717
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,692
How am I supposed
to know these two?

718
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:49,147
How am I supposed to...

719
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:53,212
Nancy Lee, alias Red.

720
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:56,155
Known associate of
both Sikes and Fagin's.

721
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:01,147
It's a pretty girl,
Oliver.

722
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:08,731
I can get you out of this,
you know.

723
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:12,251
- Get me out of what?
- Ah, see, now that,

724
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,587
that's exactly what I'm
hoping you're gonna tell me.

725
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,252
Because your little friends,
your new pals,

726
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:18,973
they're not all
that they seem.

727
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:21,852
And to be perfectly honest,
friends of Fagin and Sikes

728
00:49:21,883 --> 00:49:23,772
have a nasty habit
of ending up, well...

729
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:28,828
like that.

730
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:31,131
Tom Chitling.
He died last month.

731
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:33,532
Take a good look, Oliver.

732
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:34,812
I don't even know this Sikes.

733
00:49:35,867 --> 00:49:37,532
Are you sure?

734
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,189
I'm sure.

735
00:49:42,203 --> 00:49:43,229
Okay.

736
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:45,915
Well,
you're free to go.

737
00:49:46,938 --> 00:49:50,203
Just be careful who you trust because
people only see what they wanna see.

738
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:53,851
Off you go, then.

739
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:04,156
You're late.

740
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:07,003
Where's Twist?

741
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:09,340
He was with you,
right, Dodge?

742
00:50:14,396 --> 00:50:16,796
Just wanted to get a run-in.
I lost track of time.

743
00:50:17,754 --> 00:50:19,068
I don't know
where Twist is.

744
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,019
I gave them all the night off.

745
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,771
Those paintings are going
nowhere till the morning.

746
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:25,499
It is morning.
Where is he?

747
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:40,956
- Who is this?
- <i>Think of me</i>

748
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:43,003
<i>as the friendly uncle
you never had.</i>

749
00:50:43,035 --> 00:50:45,339
<i>I just wanted to make sure
you've got my number.</i>

750
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,540
<i>In case you remember anything
about our Ms. Sikes.</i>

751
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:49,821
I won't.

752
00:50:50,556 --> 00:50:52,700
You got some explaining
to do, boy.

753
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:57,339
- Where you been, then?
- I went to a pub with Dodge and Batesy.

754
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,803
They got back hours ago.
What happened to you?

755
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:03,963
- I got arrested.
- Been having little words, have we?

756
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:05,244
No, it wasn't
like that.

757
00:51:05,276 --> 00:51:06,908
It was this traffic warden.

758
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,572
I wrote on his van
and he wasn't happy about it.

759
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:10,396
You wrote
on his van last night?

760
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:11,963
No, last week.

761
00:51:11,996 --> 00:51:13,659
I bumped into him
this morning...

762
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:15,292
How come
the cops let you go?

763
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:18,011
Did you give them
something they wanted?

764
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:19,900
No, nothing.
I gave them nothing.

765
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:21,308
If he grassed,
why would he come back here?

766
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,492
Was I talking to you?

767
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:24,380
- I'm just saying, I...
- Don't!

768
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:26,683
- We need him.
- <i>Hello, Artnet.</i>

769
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:28,795
- <i>Hello, it's Dr. Crispin Losberne.</i>
- Shh!

770
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:30,843
<i>My vault is flooded, so I need
to move a painting to Dotheboy's.</i>

771
00:51:30,874 --> 00:51:32,571
He's on the phone
with the couriers.

772
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:33,948
They're arranging a pickup.

773
00:51:33,979 --> 00:51:35,419
<i>One second.</i>

774
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:38,395
Round three.

775
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:41,307
The painting is gonna be
on the move.

776
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:43,067
This is it.

777
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:45,275
You better pray this time
it goes like clockwork.

778
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:50,300
Remember,
I'm watching.

779
00:51:59,004 --> 00:52:01,148
I'm claustrophobic,
okay.

780
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:03,612
Nobody told me that
it was gonna be that small.

781
00:52:04,027 --> 00:52:06,588
- Quit making a fuss and get in.
- I'm not making a fuss.

782
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,338
I'm claustrophobic.
It's an actual condition.

783
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:11,867
If Batesy gets in there
and passes out,

784
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:13,756
the whole plan's screwed.
What are we gonna do?

785
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:15,772
Exactly. And there is
every chance

786
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:17,852
that if I get in there
I will pass out.

787
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:19,676
Batesy,
don't be such a baby.

788
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:21,723
What are you gonna do?
Force him down?

789
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:23,835
You say you're gonna do
something then don't do it.

790
00:52:23,866 --> 00:52:27,164
Are we gonna do this,
or you gonna stand there arguing all day?

791
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:28,284
Well, he's in now.

792
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:32,572
All right. Anybody tries
to moves the crate,

793
00:52:32,604 --> 00:52:35,100
you set off the smoke bomb
in their face.

794
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:37,115
Piece of cake.

795
00:52:37,786 --> 00:52:39,227
All right. That's it.

796
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:42,523
Let's do it then.

797
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:46,908
Really?

798
00:52:58,555 --> 00:53:00,763
Delivery to our gallery
in W1, yeah?

799
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:02,075
Yeah, copy that, darling.

800
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:03,548
We just got
a few drop-offs first.

801
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,732
Cheers, lads.

802
00:53:28,635 --> 00:53:31,163
I thought we were only sharing travel
with the National Gallery piece.

803
00:53:31,195 --> 00:53:32,731
Uh, let me see.

804
00:53:32,762 --> 00:53:34,396
Originally yours
was dropped off first

805
00:53:34,427 --> 00:53:35,772
and then on
to the National Gallery.

806
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:37,468
It's just an extra
pickup, mate.

807
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:38,844
It won't affect
your drop-off time.

808
00:53:38,874 --> 00:53:41,242
They're close together,
you see.

809
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:45,115
- Chiswell Fine Arts.
- I've never heard of it.

810
00:53:51,707 --> 00:53:54,107
You ever heard of
a Chiswell Fine Arts, Rosie?

811
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,675
Somewhere near here?

812
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,299
I thought you knew all
the galleries in London.

813
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,163
I'll google it.

814
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,484
Can't find a Chiswell.

815
00:54:14,203 --> 00:54:15,963
Get me Artnet
on the phone now!

816
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:38,876
What's all this?

817
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:46,779
You all right?
What's occurring?

818
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,668
- Can we get through?
- How you doing?

819
00:54:48,698 --> 00:54:50,108
- Yeah, fine.
- Where you from?

820
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:51,675
- I'm from Fullham.
- Fullham?

821
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:54,491
I've got cousins in Fullham.
You know Phil?

822
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:56,443
- No.
- You must know my second cousin.

823
00:54:56,475 --> 00:54:58,235
- What's her name? Oh, Tracey.
- No.

824
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:00,059
- Can we get through?
- Can you get through?

825
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:02,203
I don't know...

826
00:55:02,235 --> 00:55:04,796
<i>7-4, receiving. 7-4, receiving.</i>

827
00:55:04,826 --> 00:55:06,652
Is there aliens?
I mean...

828
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:08,091
7-4. Go ahead.

829
00:55:08,123 --> 00:55:10,267
<i>Just had a call from
the Losberne Gallery.</i>

830
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,539
<i>They seem to think
they're being robbed.</i>

831
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:15,515
Is it real?
Is life even real?

832
00:55:15,547 --> 00:55:16,987
Everything all right,
lads?

833
00:55:18,075 --> 00:55:19,611
Floor it!

834
00:55:33,818 --> 00:55:35,419
No!

835
00:55:36,924 --> 00:55:39,067
Sikes, no.
No, Sikes!

836
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:41,116
Please, Sikes.

837
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,211
Run!

838
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:49,019
- Where is it? Give it to me.
- I didn't get it. I'm sorry.

839
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:52,091
We need a distraction.
Move. Move!

840
00:55:56,794 --> 00:55:58,842
When I said "don't,"
that means don't go this way.

841
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:01,211
- <i>...female in a red leather jacket.</i>
- Hey!

842
00:56:01,242 --> 00:56:03,226
Female suspect heading west
down Pass Road.

843
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,627
<i>Officers are in pursuit.
Officers are in pursuit.</i>

844
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,028
I'm asking you
very nicely to stop.

845
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:24,924
There it is.

846
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:51,260
I really need
to start going to the gym.

847
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:53,275
This is...

848
00:57:03,899 --> 00:57:05,148
Uh...

849
00:57:06,842 --> 00:57:08,570
<i>Bedwin, give me an update.</i>

850
00:57:08,602 --> 00:57:10,811
Brownlow, we got some good news
and some bad news.

851
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:13,306
- <i>Fill me in then.</i>
- Yeah, well, the bad news is I haven't got her.

852
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:16,475
- <i>What's the good news?</i>
- There is no good news, really, if I'm honest.

853
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:18,203
<i>Get yourself back here now.</i>

854
00:57:25,147 --> 00:57:26,683
Oi! Get in.

855
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:29,723
- I need to work on my cardio.
- How come Twist was

856
00:57:29,755 --> 00:57:31,484
in the back of that van?
Should have been you.

857
00:57:32,379 --> 00:57:35,643
Well, I'm claustrophobic,
so we just switched places.

858
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,484
You shouldn't have.

859
00:57:46,427 --> 00:57:47,964
Batesy!

860
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:25,274
He should have been
back by now.

861
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:27,259
Quiet. I'm trying to think.

862
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,915
That was our one shot.

863
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:33,306
It was bad luck
is all.

864
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:35,259
Bad luck? There's no such thing.

865
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,947
It was a simple plan
until that bloody Twist

866
00:58:37,979 --> 00:58:40,154
decided to go in the van.

867
00:58:46,394 --> 00:58:48,252
Mate, have you seen...

868
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:52,091
What happened
to Tom Chitling?

869
00:58:52,123 --> 00:58:53,211
He fell.

870
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,810
- Did you see it?
- Someone has been misinforming you, Oliver.

871
00:58:58,843 --> 00:59:03,259
- Don't avoid the question!
- I just don't think it's you asking the questions.

872
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,212
Who have you been talking to?

873
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:09,372
Sikes.

874
00:59:09,978 --> 00:59:12,187
Why don't you ask her?

875
00:59:13,307 --> 00:59:15,099
- Sikes!
- He's a rat!

876
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:17,627
Van suddenly peels off.
They knew what was going down.

877
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:19,068
- I didn't tell them anything!
- Lies!

878
00:59:21,115 --> 00:59:22,459
What's this, eh?

879
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,907
Thing I need to know, Twist,

880
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,667
is how you hold up
under a beating.

881
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:30,554
I bet you fall
to pieces, eh?

882
00:59:30,587 --> 00:59:31,803
Fagin, make her stop.

883
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:42,074
Question is,
do you want some more?

884
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:45,980
Hold him.

885
00:59:47,323 --> 00:59:49,402
Sikes, don't make it
permanent.

886
00:59:49,434 --> 00:59:51,163
Right, Bullseye,
on my command.

887
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:54,554
You're making a mistake.

888
00:59:55,034 --> 00:59:56,443
A mistake?

889
00:59:57,306 --> 00:59:59,228
He got in trouble
with the traffic warden.

890
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:01,116
And how would
you know that, Red?

891
01:00:01,754 --> 01:00:03,132
'Cause I was there.

892
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,371
What?

893
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:09,467
We were on our way home
and the traffic warden

894
01:00:09,499 --> 01:00:11,323
came out of nowhere
and tackled him to the ground.

895
01:00:11,355 --> 01:00:13,307
- Just like he said.
- On your way home from where?

896
01:00:15,898 --> 01:00:16,987
We...

897
01:00:18,203 --> 01:00:20,060
We went for a swim together.

898
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,875
If he moves, shoot him.

899
01:00:34,907 --> 01:00:36,955
Come with me.

900
01:00:36,986 --> 01:00:38,203
Bullseye, stay.

901
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:52,571
This ain't like Batesy.

902
01:00:52,602 --> 01:00:54,586
He gets withdrawal symptoms
if he ain't plugged in.

903
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:56,923
- Batesy's dead.
- What?

904
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,235
Just like she killed Tom.

905
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,890
- But Sikes said...
- Tom was murdered!

906
01:01:01,626 --> 01:01:03,770
He didn't go off
that roof by accident.

907
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:06,459
How would you know that?

908
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:08,860
I got a text
off that phone.

909
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:11,962
Some cop gave it to me
to see if I'd turn.

910
01:01:11,995 --> 01:01:13,723
And did you turn?

911
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:16,700
Or were you never
with this family to begin with?

912
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,875
You call this a family?

913
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:21,146
When that psycho is
out there with Red

914
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:22,779
and you're pointing
a gun at me!

915
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,147
I don't believe you.

916
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:26,714
I'm gonna go find Batesy myself.

917
01:01:26,747 --> 01:01:28,252
You're gonna be looking
six feet under.

918
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:31,483
He's right. I pushed Tom.

919
01:01:31,514 --> 01:01:33,370
- You lying piece...
- Please.

920
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:35,195
Give me an excuse to kill you.

921
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:36,827
You can't kill all of us.

922
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:38,779
Let's see, shall we?

923
01:01:39,355 --> 01:01:41,563
Six bullets, three kids.
You do the math.

924
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:43,931
We're hitting Dotheboy's.
We're getting that painting.

925
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:45,819
Dotheboy's?
I think the whole plan

926
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:48,346
was to get the painting
before it went there.

927
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:50,587
That place
is impenetrable.

928
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:52,219
You scared, old man?

929
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,131
I'll have a plan
in four hours.

930
01:01:55,642 --> 01:01:58,683
Try not to kill any more
of them in the meantime.

931
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:02,651
I can't promise anything.

932
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:13,210
<i>Look, mate,
I believe ya.</i>

933
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:16,219
<i>What Sikes did to Tom,
that's messed up.</i>

934
01:02:16,794 --> 01:02:19,099
But if we don't do this,
we'll lose Red too.

935
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,363
Sikes is a loose cannon.

936
01:02:22,394 --> 01:02:24,443
Let's just suck it up
and get on with it, yeah?

937
01:02:26,138 --> 01:02:27,483
Let's do this.

938
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,258
<i>Is he on time?</i>

939
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,980
Like clockwork. We're on.

940
01:02:50,427 --> 01:02:52,091
Can I get two sugars
with that, as well?

941
01:02:52,826 --> 01:02:54,554
All right there, mates?
Sorry to interrupt.

942
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:56,410
Can I get a Bakewell tart,
please?

943
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:57,947
Sure.

944
01:02:58,459 --> 01:03:00,283
- It's chippy, innit?
- Yeah, I know. It's freezing.

945
01:03:00,315 --> 01:03:02,043
There you go. 1.50.

946
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,834
There you go.
Keep the change.

947
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:06,172
Thanks.

948
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:09,722
Have a good day,
lads.

949
01:03:09,754 --> 01:03:10,939
See ya.

950
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:28,730
<i>The painting will be under
lock and key before the auction.</i>

951
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:32,091
<i>So our only chance is
during the main event.</i>

952
01:03:32,122 --> 01:03:34,810
<i>We'll go in at the front
and at the right moment</i>

953
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:37,723
<i>execute the plan,
sending the painting your way.</i>

954
01:03:37,754 --> 01:03:39,771
Let's play happy families, eh?
Big smiles.

955
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:59,323
Thank you.

956
01:03:59,354 --> 01:04:01,274
Whoa, whoa.

957
01:04:01,306 --> 01:04:03,323
It's the chair. Really?

958
01:04:03,835 --> 01:04:05,019
Jesus.

959
01:04:21,626 --> 01:04:23,642
There you go.

960
01:04:23,674 --> 01:04:26,299
<i>Dodge, once you're
inside, let Twist in.</i>

961
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:28,410
<i>Then, when all hell
has broken loose,</i>

962
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:29,562
<i>you know what to do.</i>

963
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:36,251
Gang's all here.

964
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,523
Don't do anything stupid.

965
01:04:55,483 --> 01:04:58,330
I'm glad you're finally taking
this threat seriously, Officer.

966
01:04:59,994 --> 01:05:01,596
Detective Inspector.

967
01:05:07,962 --> 01:05:09,372
How many men
have you deployed?

968
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:11,835
There's 12
inside the building.

969
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,363
Another 20 outside.

970
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,515
Nobody is getting
this painting, Losberne.

971
01:05:19,546 --> 01:05:21,179
Doctor Losberne.

972
01:05:31,162 --> 01:05:32,794
Better you than me,
mate.

973
01:05:49,018 --> 01:05:50,587
<i>Lot 146.</i>

974
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,114
William Hogarth's painting

975
01:05:53,146 --> 01:05:55,835
<i>A Harlot's Progress,
The Arrest.</i>

976
01:05:55,866 --> 01:05:58,746
Oil on canvas. 1731.

977
01:05:58,778 --> 01:06:00,858
Has resurfaced
after many years,

978
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,642
as the only surviving <i>Harlot's
Progress</i> from the fire...

979
01:06:03,674 --> 01:06:05,179
Now.

980
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:09,339
We start the reserve
price of three million pounds.

981
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:10,842
Yes, madam.

982
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,970
And you, sir? At the back there, sir? Yes.

983
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:16,603
Three million two.

984
01:06:16,635 --> 01:06:18,171
I have three million,
200 thousand pounds.

985
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:21,947
He's got a gun!

986
01:06:23,899 --> 01:06:25,819
- Stay calm.
- It was a trap.

987
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,538
- They're after my painting!
- Get it back in the vault!

988
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,235
It'll be safe.
It's the safest place.

989
01:06:35,515 --> 01:06:37,914
- Over there, look.
- Through that door.

990
01:06:42,682 --> 01:06:45,403
There's a robbery in progress.
Stay with the painting.

991
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:47,291
Get it to the vault.
Let's go! Let's move.

992
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,442
Wait, wait, wait.

993
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:54,139
I'm coming with you.

994
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,483
No one goes
down there but us.

995
01:06:55,514 --> 01:06:57,275
There's a robbery in progress.

996
01:06:57,307 --> 01:07:00,186
- Yeah, we have our procedures.
- And I have my orders.

997
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:02,971
And that painting ain't going
anywhere without me.

998
01:07:03,003 --> 01:07:04,955
What... What's going on?

999
01:07:04,986 --> 01:07:07,771
- Who are you?
- Officer Dawkins, Sergeant.

1000
01:07:07,802 --> 01:07:09,562
- Dawkins? Good.
- Yeah.

1001
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:54,107
Okay. You guys go that way.
You guys come with me. Let's go.

1002
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:01,530
You.

1003
01:08:02,202 --> 01:08:04,571
Yes, it's me.

1004
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:08,154
Ah, that felt good.

1005
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,819
Good. This is good.
This is very good.

1006
01:08:26,842 --> 01:08:28,348
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1007
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,796
Show me the painting.

1008
01:08:34,393 --> 01:08:35,386
Ah...

1009
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:39,098
I'll be honest,
not his best work.

1010
01:08:42,938 --> 01:08:44,347
Move!

1011
01:08:44,378 --> 01:08:45,371
Okay.

1012
01:08:49,466 --> 01:08:51,290
Oh, you silly sausage.

1013
01:08:51,322 --> 01:08:52,603
You're going nowhere, Son.

1014
01:08:54,457 --> 01:08:55,963
Shit!

1015
01:08:57,915 --> 01:08:59,930
Brownlow,
you're wrong about Twist.

1016
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:01,403
He's in the lift shaft.

1017
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:03,162
Yeah, the dirty swine.

1018
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:06,140
Well, move then.

1019
01:09:09,818 --> 01:09:11,834
I'm coming for you, Twist.

1020
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:14,779
- No, no, no!
- If you think a lift is gonna stop me...

1021
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:18,491
- Oh, you got nowhere to hide, boy.
- Dodge!

1022
01:09:18,523 --> 01:09:19,579
- You muppet.
- Dodge?

1023
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,434
You...

1024
01:09:21,465 --> 01:09:22,522
Hurry up.

1025
01:09:22,554 --> 01:09:23,738
- Dodge.
- Come on.

1026
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,018
Help me!

1027
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:26,939
- Hurry up.
- Help!

1028
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,955
- Come on.
- I'm coming!

1029
01:09:28,987 --> 01:09:30,619
Get these bloody doors open!

1030
01:09:40,058 --> 01:09:41,307
Hurry up, Dodge!

1031
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:56,346
Oi!

1032
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:04,281
Wait a minute.

1033
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,266
Give me a break.
You're not thinking we...

1034
01:10:06,298 --> 01:10:08,475
- Oi! Stop!
- Come on!

1035
01:10:11,098 --> 01:10:13,659
- Ready? Belt.
- Twist, what are you doing? This is madness.

1036
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:15,258
Three, two, one...

1037
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:19,738
Hang on!

1038
01:10:20,538 --> 01:10:22,043
Wait, wait...

1039
01:10:22,074 --> 01:10:23,258
Let go!

1040
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,002
Okay.

1041
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:32,282
Congratulations.

1042
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:34,427
All the best.

1043
01:10:38,138 --> 01:10:40,027
Brownlow, you need
to get down here right now.

1044
01:10:45,465 --> 01:10:46,714
Shit!

1045
01:10:46,746 --> 01:10:50,106
Shit, shit!

1046
01:10:50,138 --> 01:10:52,218
- Flippin' hell.
- Let's go up here.

1047
01:10:54,137 --> 01:10:55,899
I think we've lost them.

1048
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:57,979
They wouldn't have got far,
Losberne.

1049
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,354
Well,
you better be right.

1050
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,786
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hey! Hey!

1051
01:11:01,817 --> 01:11:03,323
Don't even think about it!
Do not move.

1052
01:11:03,353 --> 01:11:05,625
Hello?

1053
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:07,706
- <i>Your delivery's here.</i>
- I didn't order anything.

1054
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:10,843
- Hey, don't!
- Dodge, let's go!

1055
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,306
Hey!

1056
01:11:13,338 --> 01:11:15,355
Get after them!
Don't leave, hey!

1057
01:11:15,385 --> 01:11:17,435
- Come back here! Come...
- Wait!

1058
01:11:17,466 --> 01:11:20,474
Get them... Hey, stop!

1059
01:11:20,505 --> 01:11:23,066
Stop! Make him stop!

1060
01:11:40,507 --> 01:11:43,291
There's only one person
who could do this.

1061
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,906
<i>Batesy.</i>

1062
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:52,250
Enjoy your munch, did ya?

1063
01:11:52,282 --> 01:11:54,778
You magnificent bastard.

1064
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,682
You had us worried sick, mate.
Where are ya?

1065
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:01,530
You know Sikes has gone
full-blown psycho, don't you?

1066
01:12:01,562 --> 01:12:03,225
- <i>She tried to kill me.</i>
- What?

1067
01:12:03,258 --> 01:12:04,731
We're on our way
to see her now.

1068
01:12:04,762 --> 01:12:06,586
<i>No, don't! It ain't safe.</i>

1069
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,115
What do you mean?
We got no choice.

1070
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:11,291
<i>Red's with her.
We're all heading to Fagin's.</i>

1071
01:12:12,443 --> 01:12:14,075
All right, well,
I'll meet you there.

1072
01:12:14,107 --> 01:12:15,611
- <i>Just look after yourself.</i>
- Okay.

1073
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:18,842
That was Batesy. He's...

1074
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:22,618
Twist?

1075
01:12:27,098 --> 01:12:28,314
Twist?

1076
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,883
You're late.
Where is he?

1077
01:12:34,457 --> 01:12:36,186
I don't know.
We got split up.

1078
01:12:36,217 --> 01:12:37,785
- Who's got it?
- He has.

1079
01:12:37,818 --> 01:12:39,035
Oi!

1080
01:12:39,962 --> 01:12:42,106
- You miss me?
- Bates.

1081
01:12:42,682 --> 01:12:44,506
You all right?
What happened?

1082
01:12:44,537 --> 01:12:46,651
Thought I dealt with you,
fuck's sake.

1083
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:48,761
- Where's Twist?
- I'm right here.

1084
01:12:56,602 --> 01:12:58,458
You want the painting?
She's coming with me.

1085
01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:01,179
Do you think she's worth it?

1086
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:05,914
Try me.

1087
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,051
Do what he says.

1088
01:13:13,658 --> 01:13:15,739
You got more stones than
I gave you credit for.

1089
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:19,035
Give me that.

1090
01:13:24,889 --> 01:13:26,842
I'll always be
a step ahead of you.

1091
01:13:30,233 --> 01:13:32,090
You think
you can just take my girl?

1092
01:13:33,465 --> 01:13:34,490
It's the painting, Sikes.

1093
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:37,146
Give me the envelope
and let him go.

1094
01:13:38,234 --> 01:13:39,354
You sure that's it, Fagin?

1095
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,171
- What?
- The painting.

1096
01:13:46,841 --> 01:13:48,218
Are you sure
it's the right one?

1097
01:13:52,922 --> 01:13:54,811
Easy. Easy.

1098
01:13:55,385 --> 01:13:57,050
I'm just reaching for my phone.

1099
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,546
You guys might wanna see this.

1100
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:07,355
You see,
before I got into graffiti,

1101
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:09,787
I used to paint.

1102
01:14:09,818 --> 01:14:13,081
You lot mentioning Hogarth
got me inspired.

1103
01:14:13,114 --> 01:14:14,939
It's not bad, eh, Fagin?

1104
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:16,890
Where is it?

1105
01:14:17,273 --> 01:14:18,971
I walk out of here
with Red.

1106
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,498
I'll call you
and tell you where it is.

1107
01:14:21,529 --> 01:14:22,875
She stays with me.

1108
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,882
We need the painting, Sikes.

1109
01:14:25,913 --> 01:14:27,770
Whose side are you on?

1110
01:14:27,802 --> 01:14:30,907
All this has got to stop.
You're done. We're done.

1111
01:14:30,939 --> 01:14:32,923
All bets are off.

1112
01:14:32,954 --> 01:14:36,026
Get me the envelope
and I'll let you leave.

1113
01:14:49,498 --> 01:14:50,681
Come on.

1114
01:14:51,578 --> 01:14:53,113
You'll let me leave?

1115
01:14:59,354 --> 01:15:01,050
I choose how this ends.

1116
01:15:02,073 --> 01:15:03,707
- Fagin, Fagin.
- Fagin.

1117
01:15:04,218 --> 01:15:05,211
Fagin?

1118
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:12,666
Come on!

1119
01:15:13,402 --> 01:15:15,546
Quick! Come on, Twist!

1120
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:29,466
Come on!

1121
01:15:33,978 --> 01:15:35,419
You go first.

1122
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:36,891
I'm not going without you!

1123
01:15:36,922 --> 01:15:39,163
Listen, jump.
I'll be right behind you.

1124
01:15:39,673 --> 01:15:40,666
Go.

1125
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,545
Twist! Twist.

1126
01:15:59,577 --> 01:16:00,826
Hold on, hold on.

1127
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:02,427
Come on!

1128
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:09,498
Twist! Come on.

1129
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:10,874
Don't let go.

1130
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:20,474
No! No!

1131
01:16:23,419 --> 01:16:26,555
- Pull him up, Sikes.
- I'm sure he'll be fine. Step back!

1132
01:16:26,585 --> 01:16:28,665
Look at him, not even strong
enough to pull himself up.

1133
01:16:28,698 --> 01:16:31,226
- He's so weak.
- He's not weak!

1134
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:34,042
- You need to come with me now.
- I don't need you anymore.

1135
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:35,802
You think Twist is
the one for you?

1136
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:37,211
He's more than
you will ever be.

1137
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:38,939
I dragged you from the gutter,
looked after you,

1138
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,730
gave you everything
you needed.

1139
01:16:40,761 --> 01:16:42,010
Sikes!

1140
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:02,043
What a fine thing
capital punishment is.

1141
01:17:34,778 --> 01:17:36,251
Young man.

1142
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:41,402
I'm guessing you heard
about the reward?

1143
01:17:45,465 --> 01:17:47,067
Be there in five.

1144
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:54,489
Do we know what we're meant
to be waiting for?

1145
01:17:54,521 --> 01:17:56,699
We don't have a clue,
Bedwin.

1146
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:58,715
I'm sure we'll know
when we see it.

1147
01:17:58,746 --> 01:18:00,891
He's not exactly just gonna stroll in.

1148
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:03,450
- He's literally just strolled in.
- All right, lads?

1149
01:18:03,961 --> 01:18:06,361
- You hungry?
- You got a lot of nerve showing up.

1150
01:18:06,393 --> 01:18:08,506
- Let's just nick him now.
- Calm down, Bedwin.

1151
01:18:08,538 --> 01:18:10,202
You look like you could do
with a bacon sarnie.

1152
01:18:10,234 --> 01:18:11,962
This might be funny to you,
but this is serious.

1153
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:13,209
I need your full cooperation.

1154
01:18:13,242 --> 01:18:15,259
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cooperation?

1155
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:17,435
I've done you guys a favor.

1156
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:19,834
How's that?

1157
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:20,954
Where's the painting?

1158
01:18:20,984 --> 01:18:22,267
I don't have it.

1159
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:23,802
So where is it?

1160
01:18:23,834 --> 01:18:25,561
I'm not the criminal here.
In fact,

1161
01:18:25,594 --> 01:18:27,098
I've done all the work
for you guys.

1162
01:18:27,129 --> 01:18:28,986
Two bacon sarnies.

1163
01:18:29,017 --> 01:18:30,266
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

1164
01:18:30,297 --> 01:18:31,930
Excuse me. I didn't order this.

1165
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:34,235
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's my treat.

1166
01:18:34,265 --> 01:18:36,377
Well, that's very kind of you,
young man.

1167
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:39,578
- Yes, very kind.
- But don't think this is getting you out of trouble.

1168
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:40,922
I need you to understand
one thing.

1169
01:18:40,953 --> 01:18:42,713
You're gonna need
to start cooperating.

1170
01:18:46,009 --> 01:18:47,417
Oh, brilliant.

1171
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,482
Yeah, hello?
Very smart that was.

1172
01:18:59,513 --> 01:19:01,177
<i>A wise cop
once said to me,</i>

1173
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,129
<i>"People only see
what they wanna see."</i>

1174
01:19:03,161 --> 01:19:05,977
<i>You'll be wanting some
brown sauce with those I assume.</i>

1175
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:08,666
What do you mean... Hello? Hello?

1176
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:12,729
Brown sauce.

1177
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,113
Nah, it's...

1178
01:19:20,633 --> 01:19:22,169
It's above
the brown sauce, Bedwin.

1179
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:23,707
It's above
the brown sauce.

1180
01:19:25,753 --> 01:19:27,290
Holy shit.

1181
01:19:41,497 --> 01:19:45,018
<i>The tale of the stolen Hogarth
in an audacious raid</i>

1182
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:47,002
<i>took a bizarre twist today</i>

1183
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,330
<i>when a tip-off led detectives
to a lockup in East London</i>

1184
01:19:50,362 --> 01:19:54,170
<i>in which a large collection of
stolen artworks has been discovered.</i>

1185
01:19:54,202 --> 01:19:58,331
<i>The lockup belongs to the art
dealer Dr. Crispin Losberne.</i>

1186
01:19:58,905 --> 01:20:02,586
<i>Documents were also found
proving that Dr. Crispin Losberne</i>

1187
01:20:02,617 --> 01:20:05,530
<i>is not the legal owner
of the Hogarth.</i>

1188
01:20:05,562 --> 01:20:08,506
<i>It's alleged that
the well-established art dealer</i>

1189
01:20:08,538 --> 01:20:12,059
<i>has been making his fortune
out of selling stolen artwork</i>

1190
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:14,682
<i>and faking
the ownership documentation.</i>

1191
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:18,106
<i>A Mr. Isaac Solomon
has been named as an accomplice.</i>

1192
01:20:18,137 --> 01:20:21,659
<i>It's believed that this man
also goes by the name of Fagin.</i>

1193
01:20:22,265 --> 01:20:24,858
<i>Fagin and Sikes really
had raised some good thieves.</i>

1194
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:27,705
<i>So good they didn't know
when they were the target.</i>

1195
01:20:32,538 --> 01:20:35,066
<i>The envelope revealed
the true owners of the Hogarth</i>

1196
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:38,298
<i>and the key to the lockup where
Losberne kept the stolen paintings.</i>

1197
01:20:48,633 --> 01:20:52,282
- Holy shit.
- <i>Even Bedwin and Brownlow deserved a break.</i>

1198
01:20:52,312 --> 01:20:54,426
<i>In other arts-related news,</i>

1199
01:20:54,457 --> 01:20:57,945
<i>a mystery painting arrived
with a special delivery</i>

1200
01:20:57,976 --> 01:21:01,113
<i>for a new exhibition at
the National Gallery last week.</i>

1201
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:04,826
<i>The question everyone's asking
is: How did it get there?</i>

1202
01:21:05,466 --> 01:21:08,569
<i>The painting was added
to the exhibition by mistake</i>

1203
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:11,738
<i>but critics have gone wild
for this unknown artist</i>

1204
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:14,490
<i>and have demanded
the piece remains on display.</i>

1205
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,114
There you go, Mum.

1206
01:21:25,017 --> 01:21:28,953
<i>In fact, people can't stop
talking about the mystery artist,</i>

1207
01:21:28,986 --> 01:21:31,706
<i>with many asking
who is Molly Twist</i>

1208
01:21:31,737 --> 01:21:34,778
<i>and when and where

1209
01:21:34,808 --> 01:21:38,169
<i>Dealers are said to be willing
to offer up to 50,000</i>

1210

<i>to anyone with

1211
01:21:58,712 --> 01:22:00,313
Cheers, Nancy.

1212
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:05,177
Call me that again, Oliver,
and I will twist something you don't like.

1213
01:22:07,449 --> 01:22:09,498
All right, quit canoodling.

1214
01:22:12,152 --> 01:22:15,258
So, are you gonna stick
with us, kid?

1215
01:22:15,289 --> 01:22:17,082
Come on,
you know you wanna.

1216
01:22:17,114 --> 01:22:19,514
Look, if I'm gonna be
staying around,

1217
01:22:19,545 --> 01:22:21,561
we gotta cut out all
the nonsense and go straight.

1218
01:22:21,592 --> 01:22:24,761
- Whoa, wait.
- He's joking, right? That must be a joke.

1219
01:22:24,793 --> 01:22:28,250
What exactly do you expect
us lot to do for a job, eh?

1220
01:22:28,953 --> 01:22:30,906
You ever thought about
selling paintings?

1221
01:22:31,866 --> 01:22:34,266
A bag full of Molly Twist art
is worth a few quid.

1222
01:22:35,801 --> 01:22:36,794
Hmm?

1223
01:22:37,593 --> 01:22:40,889
<i>Like I said, no singing,
no dancing.</i>

1224
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:43,002
<i>But maybe I was wrong about
the happy ending.</i>

1225
01:22:43,962 --> 01:22:46,714
<i>I know these people.
I belong with them.</i>

1226
01:25:34,682 --> 01:25:37,307
