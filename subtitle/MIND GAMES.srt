1
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,150
Captain?

2
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,983
Sir.

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,180
Well, that's not exactly a view

4
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,097
of the Afghani desert, ain't it?

5
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,880
But I understand there's a Chick-Fil-A

6
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,083
right within arm's reach so there's that.

7
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,680
It's a beautiful office, sir.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,703
Thank you very much.

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,960
Captain, I'd like to suggest
you decorate the place.

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,073
Make it a little more homey, okay?

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,920
A lot of the soldiers
returned from deployment

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,190
where they've seen a lot of shit.

13
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,203
Excuse my French.

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,793
- Yes, sir, I completely understand.

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,370
And I promise to do
everything in my powers

16
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,670
to help these brave heroes

17
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,063
and get them back on track
to healthy civilian lives.

18
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,620
- Good.

19
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,630
So if there's anything
you need, anything at all,

20
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,230
I'm just a couple hallways away.

21
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,533
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,650
- Hey Jake.

23
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,300
- Brian.
- Good to see you, man.

24
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,410
Megan, how you doin'?

25
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,505
Hey, good.

26
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,040
- Do I have any more
appointments for the evening?

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,050
- Yes, I was actually
getting ready to call you up

28
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,510
because you do have one more.

29
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,260
I just have to confirm his details.

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,790
- You know what, I'll take it from here.

31
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,730
- Oh no, it's no problem.

32
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,640
I mean I just have to-
- No, I insist.

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,473
Thank you.

34
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,610
- Okay.

35
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,443
You sure?

36
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:06,723
- Yeah, enjoy your weekend.

37
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,873
If you insist.

38
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,244
Have a good day, sir.

39
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,411
- You as well.

40
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,087
Thank you for your patience.

41
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:27,050
- Please, I just wanted to drop by,

42
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,280
see how things are going.

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,930
I just wanted to make sure

44
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,173
everything's going smoothly on the inside.

45
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,120
- Right this way.

46
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:43,273
- Mmm, that is so happy.

47
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,346
So, did she finish the dress?

48
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:48,179
- Mhmm.

49
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:52,688
It's so beautiful, so perfect.

50
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,075
It's more beautiful than I
ever could have imagined it.

51
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:59,793
Ah, I'm so excited!

52
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,505
- Hey, I'm sorry that I can't be there.

53
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,630
- Mhmm, I'm sorry too, Missy.

54
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,583
So not okay.

55
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,740
Seriously, how's your mom doing?

56
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,832
- The doctor's are changing
up the medication again.

57
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:25,150
We just have to wait and see.

58
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,552
I am so happy for you though.

59
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,954
You don't even know how good you got it.

60
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,287
A great man, a happy family, a fun life.

61
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,603
- My life?

62
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,082
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

63
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,525
I mean I wouldn't call it perfect,

64
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:46,107
but after so long,
everything's finally going

65
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,860
in the right direction, you know?

66
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,000
Brian and I just put in
an offer on the house.

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,733
So we can finally say goodbye
to the landlords here.

68
00:05:57,298 --> 00:06:00,167
- Right, if anyone deserves it, it's you.

69
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,023
Everything you've been
through, losing the baby.

70
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:10,429
Ugh, Tara, I'm such an idiot.

71
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,380
I'm so sorry, Tara, I
shouldn't have brought it up.

72
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,068
I should have just been happy for you.

73
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,163
- No, it's okay.

74
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,413
Hey, Jules, it's okay.

75
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,593
You're still my best friend.

76
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,183
Hey, I still love you okay?

77
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,540
Hey Jules, I need to let you go.

78
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,940
I think those are the cards.

79
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:55,630
Yeah, I need to let you go.

80
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,247
Bye, I love you, talk to you later.

81
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:58,493
Mwah mwah mwah, bye.

82
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,310
Hi.

83
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,320
Are these the cards?

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,210
- You need to sign.

85
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,780
- Okay.

86
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,673
Okay, yeah.

87
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,253
Yeah, right there.

88
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,973
Great.

89
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,136
There you go.

90
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,670
- Okay, thank you so much.

91
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:14,833
What the fuck?

92
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,197
What the fuck?

93
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:26,306
What the fuck?

94
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:34,982
Hello?

95
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,374
Hello?

96
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:40,010
Is there anyone out there?

97
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:48,687
Oh my god!

98
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:50,790
Someone help me!

99
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,790
What the fuck is this?

100
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:57,179
Help!

101
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:58,991
Help!

102
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:05,269
What's happening to me?

103
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:12,073
Why is this happening to me?

104
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,388
- I give people pills and tell them

105
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,209
to call me in the morning.

106
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,626
I don't actually help people.

107
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,136
- Yeah.

108
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:27,283
Yeah it's the best feeling
in the world, actually.

109
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Helping people overcome their fears,

110
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,200
dealing with their inner demons.

111
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,390
- You're kinda like a priest,

112
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,413
exorcising demons.

113
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,583
- Brian, the demons aren't real though.

114
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,220
It's just in their minds.

115
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,433
I help them correct their thought process,

116
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,860
force them to face reality,

117
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,923
or my interpretation of it.

118
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:06,819
It brings them peace.

119
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,873
- Well the point is you help people.

120
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:14,868
- You really think so?

121
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:22,093
Hello?

122
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,430
Who are you?

123
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,280
What do you want?

124
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,303
Please let me go,

125
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:35,136
just let me go please.

126
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:35,969
- Shh.

127
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,243
In good time.

128
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:44,333
All in good time.

129
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,980
- Can I use the bathroom?

130
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,303
- Your chain will reach to the bathroom.

131
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,993
You're not an animal.

132
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,223
Yet.

133
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,333
- I don't know who you are

134
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,820
but you have the wrong person.

135
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,436
Please let me go, please.

136
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,107
Please.

137
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:39,899
I won't tell anyone, I won't.

138
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,899
- I'll pull your fucking tongue out.

139
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,415
- Please let me go, please.

140
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,823
Please let me go.

141
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,493
- In time.

142
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,260
In time.

143
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,163
All in good time.

144
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,680
- No, no, no.

145
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,878
No, no, no, please, please, please!

146
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:11,128
Please, no, no!

147
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:13,558
Please!

148
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:15,545
No!

149
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,217
I just want to be out!

150
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,416

- Tara?

163
00:14:34,644 --> 00:14:36,394
What did she buy now?

164
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,773
Oh.

165
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,477
Wow.

166
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:00,779
How sweet.

167
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:04,620
Hm.

168
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,357
- Come on, you can do this.

169
00:16:44,357 --> 00:16:45,536
You can do this.

170
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:48,270
Are you sure about this?

171
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,883
- Yes, I'm sure.

172
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,193
I have plenty of options.

173
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,520
With my credentials, there's
gonna be a local clinic

174
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,653
or a hospital that can use my experience.

175
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,880
Besides, most of these doctors

176
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,369
that are fresh out of medical school,

177
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,050
they can't really help
people that need help.

178
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,980
- Yeah, you're right about that.

179
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,613
But I don't know, I just,

180
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,270
I don't wanna be that guy

181
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,343
whose wife leaves everything for.

182
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:23,569
And I don't know, maybe 10, 20 years later

183
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,653
she resents him and kills him in the bed.

184
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,930
- Wait, wait, whoah.

185
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,360
Baby, hold up, hang on.

186
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
You think I'm going to
murder you in our bed

187
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,810
in 20 years time?

188
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:43,123
That's so cute, baby.

189
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,620
What do you think of me?

190
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,323
You know I can think of
a thousand ways to kill.

191
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,770
But bed, ugh.

192
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,680
It isn't one of them.

193
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
There's plenty of other
methods of homicide.

194
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:16,675
- How many do you know?

195
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,650
- Well I could poison you.

196
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,059
I could slip you a drug

197
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,260
that would slowly and cleanly

198
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,047
tear you apart from the inside,

199
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,420
leaving no mess at all.

200
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,533
I'm joking, baby.

201
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,683
Oh, come on.

202
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,260
You just have to know I
was an army psychologist

203
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,580
for so many years,

204
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,893
and yeah I've heard a lot of stories.

205
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,746
- I know you have.

206
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,390
- Well I wanna get out of it.

207
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,923
Open up my own practice.

208
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,680
I actually wanna help abused women.

209
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:12,320
When I'm more stable,

210
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,843
when we are more stable.

211
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,460
- Yeah, I get that, but,

212
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,210
I mean if you leave how do you know

213
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,640
if you're gonna be stable,

214
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,483
if we are gonna be stable?

215
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:28,233
You know, you never know.

216
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,190
I mean are you're really sure?

217
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,553
- Yeah.

218
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,443
Yes, I'm sure.

219
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,355
- Okay.

220
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:42,452
Okay.

221
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,373
- Yes, I am so sure.

222
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:52,513
I am so sure.

223
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,720
What did you learn at Camp McCall?

224
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,240
SEER.

225
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,673
Survival, Evasion, Resistance.

226
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,403
Escape.

227
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,260
The first moments are the most critical.

228
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,860
Try to escape before you become,

229
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,133
captured.

230
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,040
Once you become captured, your
chances of escape go down.

231
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,560
Your situation becomes
much more difficult.

232
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,170
You lose tenacity and fear takes over.

233
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,873
A weapon, you need a weapon.

234
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,820
Your mind, Tara.

235
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,920
Your mind is a weapon.

236
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,410
All those sessions with soldiers with PTSD

237
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,070
went way over the edge.

238
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,323
No other psychologist would
take them, but you did.

239
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,740
And did any of them ever harm you, no.

240
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,050
Because you used your head.

241
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,513
You controlled the situation.

242
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,590
The man who delivered the box.

243
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,590
You've seen him somewhere before, where?

244
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,000
Was he in the army?

245
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,550
Was he one of Brian's patients?

246
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,920
Did you run into him at the surplus store?

247
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,033
Think, Tara.

248
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,090
The man who delivered the box,

249
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,140
he's your first clue.

250
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,794
Don't give up.

251
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,297
Focus on something you can do.

252
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,572
Radio, get the radio.

253
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,003
Ah, fuck.

254
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,810
It's doubtful it would
be someone from the army,

255
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,260
you'd been out almost two years.

256
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,690
Next question, why.

257
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,820
Why would someone take you?

258
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,523
Use your training, Tara, think.

259
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,403
Why do people get kidnapped?

260
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,451
Think, think!

261
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:01,701
People get kidnapped for,

262
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,140
money?

263
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,973
Revenge?

264
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,330
Mental disorder like Norman from Psycho.

265
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,220
Physical torture and...

266
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,933
sex.

267
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,620
Women get kidnapped for sex,

268
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,273
for sex trafficking and
to become sex slaves.

269
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,940
Money, why wouldn't they take someone

270
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,180
with a more substantial income?

271
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,440
All of our money is going to student loans

272
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,930
and now the house,

273
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,960
and currency's going digital,

274
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,773
there's no way he'd get away with it.

275
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,770
You led a decent life.

276
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,990
You never intentionally
tried to harm anyone.

277
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,020
And you drive like an old lady

278
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,993
so road rage is out, revenge is out.

279
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,710
Wait now.

280
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,159
What about Brian's ex-girlfriend?

281
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,477
Oh no.

282
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:57,277
She's planning my bridal shower now.

283
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,630
This was too well planned out.

284
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,763
Mental disorder.

285
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,443
Even the craziest soldiers,
you treated them well.

286
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,910
And whoever did it has some
kind of medical background

287
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,210
because he knocked me out with something.

288
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,163
Physical torture.

289
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:26,010
No.

290
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,842
No, he left me food and water.

291
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:28,700
If he wanted to torture me

292
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,690
he'd make me beg for food and water.

293
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,180
Sex traffickers generally take women

294
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
who won't be missed.

295
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,513
And Brian will notice, Julie will notice.

296
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,050
But it has to be either torture or sex

297
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,210
and neither of those is an option.

298
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,043
Torture.

299
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,920
He'd beat me first.

300
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,080
He'd show me that he is the master

301
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,030
and I am the slave.

302
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,692
But both torture and sex,

303
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,120
they drug the victim first.

304
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
No.

305
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,560
You had to twist open the bottle

306
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,010
and the packages were sealed.

307
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,603
Okay, okay.

308
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,143
Sex, it has to be sex.

309
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,376
But why haven't they gang raped me yet?

310
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:14,670
It's the first step.

311
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,503
Second step.

312
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:17,550
First step is they drug the victim first.

313
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,480
But trafficking organizations
have a top age of 25

314
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,260
and I'm...

315
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,530
Evasion.

316
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,770
Your captors will deliberately
try to disorient you.

317
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,340
Think, Tara, think.

318
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,903
What do you recall before waking up here?

319
00:24:36,988 --> 00:24:37,821
Think!

320
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:41,412
I don't know.

321
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:42,495
I don't know.

322
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:44,706
Not real.

323
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:59,385
I don't recall waking up here.

324
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,486
Help!

325
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:06,100
What are you doing, be quiet.

326
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,783
Do you want to get yourself killed?

327
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,423
Listen.

328
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:27,089
I don't hear anything.

329
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,079
Birds.

330
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,193
Birds!

331
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:42,319
I'm outside somewhere.

332
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:45,867
Outside somewhere where,

333
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:48,724
where no one can...

334
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:00,211
Why is this happening?

335
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:03,628
I don't know why this is happening to me.

336
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:06,750
I don't deserve this.

337
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,290
Article V of the US Military
Code of Conduct states

338
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,950
if your questioned should
you become a prisoner of war,

339
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,960
you're required to give your name, rank,

340
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,660
service number, and date of birth.

341
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,670
You will evade answering
any further questions

342
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,170
to the utmost of your ability.

343
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,410
If your captors want
information, play dumb.

344
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,730
You're just a lowly private
who doesn't know anything.

345
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,460
If you're higher ranking,
tell them that your aides

346
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,750
work out all the battle plans for you

347
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,210
and you don't know them yourself.

348
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,960
Hell, tell them you just make
the coffee in the office.

349
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,750
But above everything else, keep the faith.

350
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,920
You will escape of you will get rescued.

351
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,958
I don't understand.

352
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,220
But you will survive

353
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,683
and you will return home with honor.

354
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:07,923
What do you want?

355
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,547
Please tell me what you want.

356
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:14,380
Please.

357
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,713
- Do you know what "de opresso
liber" means, Cassandra?

358
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,050
- My name isn't Cassandra.

359
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,110
You've got the wrong person,

360
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,310
you're making a mistake.

361
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,500
- What's in a name anyway?

362
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,463
Today, right now.

363
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,003
At this very moment,

364
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,003
your name is Cassandra.

365
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,503
My name is Bruce.

366
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,583
Now.

367
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,533
Say your name.

368
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,390
Say your name.

369
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,223
- Cassandra.

370
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,803
- Good.

371
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,750
Have a pleasant night, Cassandra.

372
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,113
- Wait, Bruce.

373
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,283
Bruce.

374
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,540
What do you want?

375
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,400
I don't have any money.

376
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,950
Have I hurt you, do I know you?

377
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:53,030
I don't know any Cassandras,

378
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,313
you're making a mistake.

379
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,340
Please, just let me go.

380
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,373
Just let me go, Bruce, please.

381
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:04,602
- You will tell no one?

382
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:06,602
No one, no one, I swear to God.

383
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:08,841
I swear.

384
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,687
- Soon.

385
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:15,143
But not yet, Cassandra.

386
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,170
All in good time.

387
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:19,553
All in good time.

388
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,763
- Bruce, Bruce!

389
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,100
Wait, no, no!

390
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,477
Why am I here?

391
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,450
- We're here to help people.

392
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,930
- Sometimes I wonder whether I'm helping

393
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,793
anyone at all.

394
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,740
- Captain, you couldn't have known.

395
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,573
- No, I should have known.

396
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:56,730
He was my patient, I was
treating him, I was...

397
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,883
- You said it before, Captain.

398
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,483
We can't save everyone.

399
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,823
- But Eddie, I,

400
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:07,150
Eddie, I could have saved him!

401
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,143
- These soldiers are mentally unsound.

402
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,287
- No, it's my fault.

403
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:12,511
There was something I missed.

404
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,760
There was something...

405
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,100
There was something I missed.

406
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,973
- They undergo extensive training.

407
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,650
They're deprived of rest and food

408
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,713
for weeks on end.

409
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,120
Now he probably knew exactly

410
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,473
what you wanted to hear.

411
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,583
And Captain, he wanted to go back.

412
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,483
And that is not your fault.

413
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,173
- Colonel, sir, it is my fault.

414
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,543
It's my job.

415
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,400
I should have seen through his act.

416
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,860
I should have confirmed my suspicions

417
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,980
on his diagnosis way before
any of this happened.

418
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,640
I could have closed the gate on this.

419
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,790
He killed a whole team
of Afghan nationals.

420
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,750
And they never saw it coming.

421
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,350
They weren't there for the A-team.

422
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,773
You and I both know that.

423
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:18,510
They took it way beyond self-defense.

424
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,060
It was way beyond self-defense.

425
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,310
It was walking around with
their bloody intestines

426
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,791
all over his shoulders

427
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:26,680
and he was going to each-

428
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,513
- Captain!

429
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,973
Don't.

430
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,923
Please don't.

431
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,630
- Bruce said "de opresso liber".

432
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,953
To free the opressed.

433
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:45,680
Bruce was a green beret.

434
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,657
Or PSYOPs, he might be
doing this because of Eddie.

435
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,490
But why?

436
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:52,497
There's nothing to be gained.

437
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,750
I can't tell the army Eddie's okay,

438
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,250
it's too late for that.

439
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,870
Why?

440
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,220
- Because it will help you.

441
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:09,449
- The mission's classified.

442
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,770
- Yes, of course, Eddie, but

443
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,450
I do have the necessary
clearance for this and

444
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,650
everything we talk about
remains classified.

445
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,700
Look, you don't have to tell me anything

446
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,670
you don't wanna talk about.

447
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,593
Just tell me about how you're feeling,

448
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,100
what you're thinking,

449
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,883
so we can sort through this together.

450
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:35,716
- We.

451
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,020
I like the way you just did that.

452
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,400
- And what was that?

453
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:47,236
- The way you took my problem

454
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:48,773
and made it about us.

455
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,853
You're good.

456
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:55,813
But you're gonna somehow keep my demons

457
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,023
locked in the closet?

458
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,316
- You have to trust me, Eddie.

459
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,980
I'm really here to help you.

460
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,813
- Trust?

461
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,560
That's a good one, Doc.

462
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,170
You know, that's exactly what
we would say to the natives

463
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,850
whenever we would stroll
up in their village

464
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,830
wanting them to put
their lives in the line

465
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,283
to fight our war.

466
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,293
Trust us.

467
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,093
Trust us.

468
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,443
We are here to help.

469
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,910
You know like I know that's
nothing but bullshit.

470
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,293
We train them to fight.

471
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,833
Then when the president says it's enough,

472
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,023
we get to go home to America.

473
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,000
While those natives have
to watch their daughters

474
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,690
get raped and slaughtered
like fucking pigs.

475
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,180
- Eddie, you were doing your job.

476
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,000
You cannot believe that those people

477
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,762
were your responsibility.

478
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:06,663
Yeah, okay.

479
00:34:08,495 --> 00:34:10,280
- Look, if it was really that bad

480
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,723
why do you wanna go back?

481
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,513
- Now there's a good question, good girl.

482
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,672
Because,

483
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,803
it's the only thing I know how to do.

484
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,770
And I'm very, very good at it.

485
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:33,580
- Okay, Eddie.

486
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,090
Why don't you tell me a little bit of

487
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,139
how you came to be on the Special Forces?

488
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,710
Tell me a little bit
about your family life.

489
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,570
Did you have any brothers and sisters?

490
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,320
What did your father do for a living?

491
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,719
Tell me a little bit about your mother.

492
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,480
Let me get to know you a little bit.

493
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,043
- We're gonna do this?

494
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,643
Four professions that I truly despise.

495
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,283
You wanna hear 'em?

496
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,150
Yeah.

497
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,470
- Okay.

498
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,480
One, attorneys.

499
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,467
Fucking hate 'em.

500
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,863
Two, doctors.

501
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,933
Three, good old car salesmen.

502
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,133
And four, my favorite of
the bunch, psychologists.

503
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,833
Because y'all think that
you know more than me.

504
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:47,727
And you believe in that
warped fucking mind

505
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,733
that I need your help.

506
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,953
I don't.

507
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,373
- Eddie, I'm here to help you.

508
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,463
- You read my file.

509
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,280
You know that I was orphaned
at the age of seven.

510
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,613
You know that I graduated
from high school with honors.

511
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:11,333
You know that I got a
Bachelor's Degree in Education.

512
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,900
And you also know that after three years

513
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,750
I joined the army.

514
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,660
And then after that, after two,

515
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,453
I was selected for green berets.

516
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,830
You know everything about me.

517
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,088
But you wanna sit there,

518
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:29,020
look me in my eyes

519
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,240
and play these little
fucking mind games with me

520
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,360
about how I'm feeling.

521
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,450
And whether the fact that
my father was a minister

522
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,913
is causing me to doubt what I'm doing.

523
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,803
Your fath-

524
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,970
My father,

525
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,063
was a mechanic.

526
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,607
But you already knew that.

527
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,743
Doc.

528
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,110
I'm tired of killing.

529
00:37:04,707 --> 00:37:06,120
But it's all I know.

530
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,018
It's all I know.

531
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,550
- Eddie, I have read your file.

532
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,070
And I also know that you and your team

533
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,333
rescued many, many hostages.

534
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,653
You might have taken lives,

535
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,133
but you saved many, many more.

536
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,410
Lives that would have been lost

537
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,893
had you not been there.

538
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,310
You've done a lot of good.

539
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
- We have a motto in the Special Forces.

540
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:47,997
"De opresso libre".

541
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,963
To free the opressed.

542
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,157
You think about that.

543
00:37:54,157 --> 00:37:56,303
- It has to be related to Eddie, but why?

544
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,770
The families of the soldiers?

545
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,540
Do they want revenge?

546
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,410
Eddie was also a part

547
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,333
of the Apsychological Operations Unit.

548
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,770
They were responsible for
using nonviolent means

549
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,570
to persuade enemy and neutral nations

550
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,140
to take actions that the
US Government wanted.

551
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,640
This is because of Eddie then.

552
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,130
Do they want me to talk?

553
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:28,477
Is this a trick?

554
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:34,716
If this isn't about Eddie and I,

555
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:35,923
don't use the radio then.

556
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,970
They'll torture, rape and kill me.

557
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,870
Is it worth the risk?

558
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,703
No, not yet.

559
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,810
Brian will call the police.

560
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,210
They'll interview the neighbors.

561
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,610
Mrs. Olson, the busybody,
she's always watching.

562
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,932
She will tell them that you got kidnapped.

563
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:01,240
She'll give them the license plate number.

564
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,550
The police will track the
vehicle to this location.

565
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,500
They will find you.

566
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,810
Just keep the faith, Tara.

567
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,973
Keep the faith.

568
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
Yeah.

569
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,050
Yeah, yeah Brian's gonna find me.

570
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,100
I know it, I know it, he's gonna find me.

571
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,653
She's not at the house.

572
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,500
Do you know where she is?

573
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,300
You didn't get her text?

574
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,340
- No, no.

575
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,740
Well, no.

576
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,040
She said that
she decided to talk

577
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,690
to her former Colonel to
see about getting referrals.

578
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,350
Colonel Reeder
in North Carolina?

579
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,707
Yes, at Fort Bragg?

580
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:03,890
- But we were supposed to
see the venues this week.

581
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,477
She said that she'd
be gone at least three days.

582
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:08,790
- But why would she go
to Fort Bragg, I mean?

583
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,920
Clients.

584
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,240
The Colonel said he'd work up a list

585
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,820
of current and former military wives

586
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,063
who might be interested
in counseling sessions.

587
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,650
- Okay, um...

588
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,580
I shouldn't tell you

589
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,100
but she was hoping this would be something

590
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,150
of a wedding present.

591
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,570
She knows you spent a lot,

592
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,540
and she loves you more than anything,

593
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,853
you have to know that.

594
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,093
By the way, put the cards
in the refrigerator.

595
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,290
- All right, yeah, cool.

596
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,333
All right Julie, I'll talk to you later.

597
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,563
Thanks, bye.

598
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,750
Put the cards in the refrigerator?

599
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,150
- It shouldn't be this cold.

600
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,510
Don't be stupid, he's
using sensory torture.

601
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:00,290
And what makes you think he didn't plant

602
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,180
the radio there for you to use?

603
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,280
To get you to talk, to spill your secrets!

604
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,740
The radio was over there, it was hiding.

605
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,790
He probably didn't even know it was here.

606
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,630
He chained you to the RV floor,

607
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,430
of course he would have searched it.

608
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,140
Well if he thought this
was a temporary place,

609
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,973
maybe he didn't know.

610
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:24,553
Maybe he didn't know it was here.

611
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,000
But if I don't use the
radio and he comes back...

612
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,050
Don't think about what could happen.

613
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,103
Think about escape.

614
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:49,320
It's worth the risk.

615
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,420
It's your only chance.

616
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,693
Hello?

617
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,110
Hello, is there anyone there?

618
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,993
Hello, hello, is there anyone there?

619
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,400
Someone please an...

620
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,020
Someone please answer me.

621
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,860
Hello?

622
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,439
Hello, please, someone.

623
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:02,939
This is so stupid.

624
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:07,091
Yeah, I'm here.

625
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,370
- Hi, hi.

626
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,203
I need help.

627
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,133
Yeah, well don't we all?

628
00:43:16,784 --> 00:43:18,130
- No, I'm serious.

629
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,130
I've been kidnapped.

630
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,753
Yeah sure, tell me another one.

631
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,550
- I'm being serious.

632
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,070
Somebody took me out of my apartment

633
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,044
and put me in an RV.

634
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:31,340
Oh, I get it.

635
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,180
You and your girlfriends are
taking a little road trip

636
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,133
in an RV, huh?

637
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,410
Well, radio's not a thing
to play around with.

638
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,560
Like, you teasing the guys, huh,

639
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,580
so get the hell off the air

640
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,190
and go tell your girlfriends that-

641
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,040
- I'm being fucking
serious, I got kidnapped!

642
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,390
Then call the cops!

643
00:43:49,082 --> 00:43:50,879
- I don't have a phone.

644
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:51,712
You don't have a phone,

645
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,423
my five year old niece has a phone!

646
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:00,450
- I have a phone but it's in my apartment.

647
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,303
Would you please call the cops?

648
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,340
Sure, sure, yeah, yeah.

649
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,770
Let's start with the basics, okay?

650
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,420
What's your name?

651
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,793
- Tara, Tara Mays.

652
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,890
I'm Kenny.

653
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,190
But you can call me Kenny

654
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,610
but I'd prefer Bullet.

655
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,190
- Okay, thank you, Kenny.

656
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,553
Bullet, thank you, Bullet.

657
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,600
Where are you?

658
00:44:22,151 --> 00:44:23,675
- I'm inside of an RV.

659
00:44:23,675 --> 00:44:26,020
Yeah, you said that,

660
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,060
but where the fuck is the RV?

661
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,893
- I don't know.

662
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,760
Wait a minute.

663
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,800
You want me to call the cops

664
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,390
and tell them that you've been kidnapped

665
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,940
but I don't know where you are?

666
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,490
How the hell are they gonna find you?

667
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,210
No, no, no, no, see, this is how it works,

668
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,240
I call the cops, they'll make a record,

669
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,180
put my name on file.

670
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,210
Then when they can't find you

671
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,630
they'll put a note in my electronic file

672
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,550
saying that I'm a crank caller.

673
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,110
And then when I really
need the cops and call 'em,

674
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,710
these guys are gonna laugh
at me and just, you know?

675
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,040
- The police are gonna
interview my neighbors.

676
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,780
Talk to Mrs. Olson, she
would have seen something.

677
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,080
How old are you?

678
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,750
- I don't see how that fucking matters!

679
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,030
Are you over 18?

680
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,760
Then the cops are gonna say
you had a right to disappear.

681
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,420
They don't find any sign of
a crime at your apartment,

682
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,420
they'll just blow it off,

683
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,593
but you know, they'll know my name.

684
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:27,470
- Then don't give 'em your name.

685
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,930
Please, don't give them your name

686
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,903
but call the fucking cops now!

687
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,153
Hello?

688
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,363
Bullet, hello?

689
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,810
Bullet, are you still there?

690
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:50,516
Oh god.

691
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,837
You did it again, Tara.

692
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,795
When will you ever learn?

693
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:29,690
Roger, I completely
understand what you're saying.

694
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:33,193
Ah, fuck you too.

695
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,493
Sorry.

696
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,012
- We've both been in the same uniform and-

697
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:44,617
- Yeah?

698
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:46,770
But have you ever gotten
blood on your uniforms?

699
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,603
No.

700
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,173
Maybe a little of that sweet
sweat that runs down your back.

701
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,063
Ever killed anyone, Doc?

702
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,470
- Roger, there's many
people in the military

703
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,190
who perform invaluable duties, and

704
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,690
all of these which-

705
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,167
- You've never even thought
about killing someone, have you?

706
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,160
No.

707
00:47:30,443 --> 00:47:31,276
- Okay Roger, we're here to talk about-

708
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:33,150
- Yeah I know, we're
here to talk about me,

709
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,240
I know, not what you think you've done

710
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,860
or what you think you're capable of doing.

711
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,710
I know, I get it.

712
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,370
So long as you
people have me locked up

713
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,730
in this godforsaken building,

714
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,530
rotting and waiting for what?

715
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,513
Yes, I kill people,
civilians, yes, I get it.

716
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,070
Right, isn't that why we're here?

717
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,600
Well yes, but I'm here-

718
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,580
- I killed those kids

719
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,540
because God only knows which
one of those little bastards

720
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,673
was gonna be a plant.

721
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:05,020
Had I not killed those kids,

722
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,366
and they'd gone on to kill the target,

723
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:09,133
my men could have died.

724
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,583
Get it?

725
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,733
- Okay Roger, I think we're gonna-

726
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:16,213
- And I will do it again.

727
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,813
Isn't that what you really wanna know?

728
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:29,148
Oh no.

729
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,113
You wanna know if I have nightmares.

730
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,533
Right?

731
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,453
And that if I'd do it again.

732
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,210
Nightmares about putting
rounds to the heads

733
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,623
of 10 year old kids.

734
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,343
And if I would do it again.

735
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,720
Yeah Doc, I would.

736
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,430
And no, I don't have nightmares.

737
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,240
I did what I had to do.

738
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,253
I did what I was trained to do!

739
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:08,769
You don't know shit.

740
00:49:14,053 --> 00:49:15,153
- I do know something.

741
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:19,410
And I know we're not really here

742
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,300
because you protected your team.

743
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,890
We are here because of the allegations

744
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:23,723
of your sexual-

745
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:26,400
- You better watch your
fucking mouth, bitch!

746
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,087
I could kill you right fucking now

747
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:30,173
and there's nothing you
could do to stop me.

748
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,167
You, you don't know me.

749
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,663
- Roger please, I need you to calm down.

750
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,027
Things are gonna go a lot easier on you

751
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:41,283
if you do what I say.

752
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,903
- You killed me.

753
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,813
You killed me!

754
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,397
No.

755
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:03,338
That was not my fault.

756
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:04,570
- Of course it's not my fault.

757
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,540
From what you told me about Roger,

758
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,840
he's a real piece of work.

759
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,703
Psychopath, sociopath.

760
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,360
It's not your fault.

761
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,000
If it was anybody's fault,

762
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,450
it's the guards for having
not searched his cell.

763
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:27,620
- Roger hung himself
in his room yesterday.

764
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,853
And I didn't put him on suicide watch.

765
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:34,610
I didn't think he was self-destructive.

766
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,484
I didn't think he was gonna...

767
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,980
- You're given a certain amount of time

768
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:44,073
to get to know and come
to your conclusion.

769
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,020
But that's not your fault.

770
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,120
Maybe if you had more time
or fewer cases, but...

771
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,140
- No, I had enough time.

772
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,283
But my conclusion was wrong.

773
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,779
It's my fault that he's dead.

774
00:51:02,779 --> 00:51:04,240
I should have known.

775
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:13,140
If Brian finds out,

776
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,903
he's never gonna trust me again.

777
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,800
He's always been so
skeptical about my work.

778
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,740
And now this is...

779
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,850
He doesn't think I'm
cut out to handle people

780
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:34,810
when I'm so...

781
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,554
When I'm so fragile myself.

782
00:51:58,334 --> 00:52:01,917
Tara, baby,
dinner's about ready!

783
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,743
Baby, come away with me.

784
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,730
Leave that nutcase.

785
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,090
You can get out.

786
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,133
I can get my pension ready instead.

787
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,743
You and me, we'll live
off the grid together.

788
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,880
- Brian, that's not what you think.

789
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,154
- Hey, what's happening?

790
00:52:41,154 --> 00:52:41,987
No, no!

791
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:49,693
No!

792
00:52:49,693 --> 00:52:50,526
No, no!

793
00:52:54,452 --> 00:52:58,136
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live!

794
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:02,336
No!

795
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:06,815
Lay back, baby,
lay back baby, lay back.

796
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:09,018
Lay back, baby, lay back.

797
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,223
- It's not real.

798
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,730
You're just examining your life.

799
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,910
The bad things.

800
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,960
You have no idea where you are?

801
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,593
- No.

802
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:44,603
I don't know.

803
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,180
Right, anything in that RV

804
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,543
to show who owns it?

805
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,350
Maybe the photograph, name, registration,

806
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,220
something personal, something I can run

807
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,270
through the internet.

808
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,753
- I know I'm in a field, a remote field.

809
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:10,030
Oh, sure, little miss militia.

810
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,020
That narrows it right down.

811
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,570
I'll call the NSA right now

812
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,810
and have them pull up all
of their satellite photos

813
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,850
for empty fields.

814
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,537
Or why don't you just send
up a flare or something?

815
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:19,960
- Look, I'm trying, okay?

816
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,793
I'm trying.

817
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:26,820
Okay, okay, look.

818
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,230
Search around.

819
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,230
See if you can find
something in the RV, okay?

820
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,370
I'm gonna call some buddies

821
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,290
and see if they know anything.

822
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,740
I'll talk to you later.

823
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,843
- Wait.

824
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:37,676
Bullet.

825
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,180
Bullet, are you still there?

826
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,513
Okay.

827
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:55,556
Okay.

828
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,233
Look around.

829
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:07,902
Okay.

830
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,213
Timothy Harrison.

831
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,410
Laura Kennington.

832
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:39,836
Phone number.

833
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,919
You on the air?

834
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,223
- Bullet, yeah, yeah, I'm here.

835
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,340
Okay, so here's the deal.

836
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,313
No one has reported you missing.

837
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,293
- What?

838
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,010
What about Brian?

839
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,790
It hasn't been on the news, nothing?

840
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:01,623
Nothing?

841
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:03,470
Oh jeez Louise,
don't get your panties

842
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,140
in a knot, huh?

843
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,800
More hostages get themselves killed

844
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,900
when their captors figure out

845
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,370
that someone has reported them missing.

846
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:13,860
Count yourself lucky that no
one has reported you missing.

847
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,113
All right, now, did
you do like I told you?

848
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:19,290
Did you search the place, find some names,

849
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,687
something I can track down, anything?

850
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:26,150
- Yeah, yeah, I have names.

851
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,333
Timothy Harrison and Laura Kennington.

852
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,983
What kind of
fucked up name is Kennington?

853
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,110
- I don't know, British?

854
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,762
And I have a phone number.

855
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:43,173
208-558-4848.

856
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:47,120
Hmm, well
that's not a local number.

857
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,480
I'll check the area code.

858
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,260
- I have a street address.

859
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,423
6155 North Main Street.

860
00:56:54,617 --> 00:56:57,558
You feel like
sharing the city with me?

861
00:56:57,558 --> 00:56:58,640
- It doesn't have a city.

862
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,750
But it came with the phone number

863
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,243
so it should be whatever area code 208 is.

864
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,333
Wow, hey, you're sharp.

865
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,253
What else?

866
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,160
- E. Jennings.

867
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,542
Wow.

868
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:16,190
Now I wonder how many
E. Jennings there are.

869
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,023
Anything else?

870
00:57:19,362 --> 00:57:20,520
- No, I stopped searching.

871
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,263
I couldn't find anything.

872
00:57:25,037 --> 00:57:28,223
- At this very moment,
your name is Cassandra.

873
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,823
My name is Bruce.

874
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,170
- Wait.

875
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,728
Wait, he said his name was Bruce

876
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:39,960
and that mine was Cassandra.

877
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,570
Why the fuck
didn't you tell me that

878
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,440
to begin with?

879
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,490
- I don't know, I don't know.

880
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,140
I just thought of that right now.

881
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:47,853
Hey, you know what?

882
00:57:47,853 --> 00:57:49,340
Why don't you try getting kidnapped

883
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,370
and having a chain on
your ankle, and, and...

884
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,820
What kind of chain?

885
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,640
It's important.

886
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,420
Everything you see, everything Bruce says,

887
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,140
it's all important.

888
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,920
Now what kind of chain?

889
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,290
Big links, small links?

890
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,350
And what kind of lock?

891
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,923
Combination or key?

892
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,830
- I don't know, it's a normal chain,

893
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,000
it's small links.

894
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,590
It's heavy.

895
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:19,150
And a key lock, an old key lock.

896
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,603
Like it's been used a lot.

897
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,300
He's had a lot of victims.

898
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:28,700
Okay, okay, I'll
run over what you gave me.

899
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,813
Just stay strong, I'll find ya.

900
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,363
- Thank you so much, Bullet.

901
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,770
I don't know what I would do

902
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,777
if I wasn't talking to you right now.

903
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,320
Listen, give me a few hours.

904
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,670
- Don't push him.

905
00:59:04,475 --> 00:59:06,142
He's your only hope.

906
00:59:13,072 --> 00:59:14,739
He's your only hope.

907
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,923
You have to trust me.

908
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,703
- I didn't do it.

909
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,540
- They have the other boot,

910
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,040
I found this one in your room.

911
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:47,254
- I didn't do it.

912
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,730
- George, the wear pattern on this boot

913
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,643
matches the one they have in evidence.

914
00:59:57,454 --> 00:59:58,553
- I didn't do it!

915
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,880
- George, I'm trying to help you.

916
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:05,873
Before any of this happened,

917
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:08,683
I'm the one who helped you
deal with the loss of your son.

918
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:13,690
- What was that again?

919
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,220
Say that again?

920
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,603
You were here to help me when my son died?

921
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:22,520
You know how you helped me?

922
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,240
You told me everything
happens for a reason.

923
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,940
Now you tell me right now,
you tell me right now,

924
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,390
what is the reason for a
six year old boy to die?

925
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,573
- I can't help you if you don't help me.

926
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,540
When I testify, I will have to tell them

927
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,083
that you were under no stress.

928
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,740
There was no good reason
for you to kill your wife,

929
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,013
cut her up, and put her in the trash.

930
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,323
I didn't kill Veronica!

931
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,693
- They will give you the death penalty.

932
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,870
- Yes, it was my knife.

933
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,410
I know it was my knife,

934
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,520
but it wasn't me, you have to believe me.

935
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,743
I didn't...

936
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:28,845
Kill her.

937
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,553
- No one is going to believe you, George.

938
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:40,900
But if you trust me...

939
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,210
Tell me about how it
was your wife Veronica

940
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,443
who left your son alone.

941
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,683
George, tell me about,

942
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,460
tell me about all those
nightmares you've had

943
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,550
since his death.

944
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,383
Tell me about-

945
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,216
- Wait.

946
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,760
Are you asking me to lie?

947
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,933
- If you don't lie, you
don't have any hope.

948
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:17,883
He lied.

949
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,870
And I wrote my report.

950
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,270
And then they caught him in the lie.

951
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:34,750
And now poor George is
set to fry.

952
01:03:05,322 --> 01:03:06,322
- Cassandra.

953
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,383
- Bruce?

954
01:03:12,642 --> 01:03:13,475
- Good.

955
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,720
Very good.

956
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,340
- Please let me go.

957
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,173
Please.

958
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,403
- I need you to change.

959
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:30,230
- What?

960
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:31,063
Why?

961
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,330
- It's what I want.

962
01:03:34,529 --> 01:03:37,113
- Please, tell me why
you want me to change.

963
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,090
- Because we're meeting friends.

964
01:03:42,032 --> 01:03:43,530
- And you don't think
your friends will like me

965
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,053
in this dress, Brian?

966
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:50,080
- Babe, we're going to Applebee's,

967
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,280
not the Playboy mansion.

968
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,623
- I've had a bad day.

969
01:03:57,427 --> 01:03:58,427
I've had a bad week.

970
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,763
It's been a bad fucking month.

971
01:04:05,492 --> 01:04:07,997
The whole year's been fucking bad, Brian.

972
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,640
So I'm gonna wear this fucking dress now!

973
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,133
Sorry, baby.

974
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:27,166
How did I?

975
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,340
He's trying to wear you down with lights

976
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,303
and loud music.

977
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,143
Remember the story of Noriega in Panama?

978
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,650
He finally surrendered
after PSYOPS bombarded him

979
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,140
with lights and heavy metal music.

980
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,783
Why is he trying to break me?

981
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:10,683
Yo, Tara, you on the air?

982
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,120
- Yes, yes I'm here.

983
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:16,953
He was just here.

984
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:18,308
He's using lights and music and-

985
01:05:18,308 --> 01:05:20,071
- Yeah, you know, I
try them too, with my dates.

986
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:21,960
You know, a little romantic
music, candlelight,

987
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,840
little some, you know, Kenny G.

988
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,770
Puts 'em in the mood.

989
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,400
- He's not trying to date me, Bullet.

990
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,766
- Oh, yeah, right, sorry, sorry,

991
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:31,360
didn't mean to.

992
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,860
- Have you found out
anything else about this guy?

993
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,950
What about the names I gave you, anything?

994
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,283
Yeah, but you won't like it.

995
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:42,643
- I don't care, tell me.

996
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,993
Sometimes what you
don't know won't hurt you.

997
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,453
- Got it, Kenny, just tell me.

998
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,620
Okay, you just remember,

999
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,640
I gave you the chance not to know.

1000
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,300
- Please, just tell me.

1001
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,133
Okay.

1002
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,470
I'll start with the names you gave me.

1003
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,160
Timothy Harrison,

1004
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,050
he was five years old

1005
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,560
when he went missing.

1006
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,610
They never found him.

1007
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,130
- How did he end up in here?

1008
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,040
His family was
at a campground in Georgia.

1009
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,990
Someone snatched him out of their tent.

1010
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,970
- He used this RV to kidnap a child.

1011
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,210
Laura Kennington,
she went missing

1012
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,043
when she was 18.

1013
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,533
She was camping with some
friends in Louisiana.

1014
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,513
- He's using this RV to-

1015
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:29,730
- Yeah, her
parents committed suicide,

1016
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:30,593
or so they say.

1017
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,330
A month after Laura went missing,

1018
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:38,090
the neighbor found her
parents in their bedrooms

1019
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:40,133
with bullet wounds in their heads.

1020
01:06:42,434 --> 01:06:46,560
- And you don't believe
it was suicide, why?

1021
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,430
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, they left a note

1022
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,920
saying some bullshit about
they had nothing to live for,

1023
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,180
but I...

1024
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,013
- But what?

1025
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,313
They didn't find the gun.

1026
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,320
You don't put a bullet in your head

1027
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,283
then get up and you know, bury the gun.

1028
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,007
They find the gun next to you.

1029
01:07:08,063 --> 01:07:10,090
- So you think he kidnapped Laura,

1030
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,980
went back to her house,
picked up some things

1031
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,130
and killed her parents?

1032
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:15,773
That's what I would think.

1033
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:19,310
- What about the phone number I gave you,

1034
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,130
the street address?

1035
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:23,570
It comes back to
an Idaho State Park Office.

1036
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:27,260
The address looks like it
was a mail drop, you know?

1037
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,830
Just a bunch of PO boxes,

1038
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,660
but people were using
it as an office address.

1039
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,493
- Idaho?

1040
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,670
I looked at the State Park.

1041
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:37,610
There'd been over 15 missing persons

1042
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:40,320
since early 1990s.

1043
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,453
All from that park.

1044
01:07:43,722 --> 01:07:45,690
- He's using that RV to...

1045
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,410
Funny thing,
there was a park ranger

1046
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:51,290
by the name of Emmett Jennings.

1047
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:52,220
E. Jennings?

1048
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,770
- So he's working with someone.

1049
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,383
Well that's what it looks like.

1050
01:08:08,704 --> 01:08:11,940
- There's something you're not telling me.

1051
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:13,290
What are you not telling me?

1052
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,710
It's something
of an urban legend,

1053
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,410
probably just a bunch of bullshit.

1054
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,258
- Tell me.

1055
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:21,253
Okay, here goes.

1056
01:08:22,639 --> 01:08:24,130
A couple of teenage girls reported

1057
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:25,969
that they were camping around Jacksonville

1058
01:08:25,969 --> 01:08:28,697
and some older guy camped next to 'em.

1059
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,952
At first, you know, he was helpful.

1060
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:34,069
He said his name was Bruce

1061
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:36,673
and said he had a teenage
daughter named Tiffany.

1062
01:08:38,468 --> 01:08:40,440
- His daughter's name is Tiffany.

1063
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,809
Yeah.

1064
01:08:41,809 --> 01:08:45,753
Son's name was Billy and his
wife's name was Cassandra.

1065
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:49,763
- Son's name was Billy,
his wife's name was...

1066
01:08:50,755 --> 01:08:52,673
He thinks I'm his wife.

1067
01:08:54,077 --> 01:08:56,360
Well he was in an old RV.

1068
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,830
Anyway, the girls got into the RV

1069
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,889
and he gave them some Mary Jane.

1070
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:01,450
And they started to get stoned

1071
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:03,067
and he started coming on to 'em.

1072
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,300
The girls said that he told them

1073
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,350
that he had been in the army.

1074
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,200
Special Forces,

1075
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,700
when he pulled out some
logging chains and a lock.

1076
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:14,490
- So did they run?

1077
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,750
Yeah, they ran.

1078
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,410
Other people in the country have reported

1079
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:19,490
seeing Bruce and the RV.

1080
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,389
- Is that it, that's all to the story?

1081
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,760
Well, I talked to some buddies

1082
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,760
and they said Bruce is a collector.

1083
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,860
- What does that mean?

1084
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:35,389
Yeah, from what the girls said,

1085
01:09:35,389 --> 01:09:37,450
while Bruce was on Operation Desert Storm,

1086
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:40,170
his family back in Iowa was killed

1087
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,563
in a robbery gone bad.

1088
01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:45,194
- But his wife, his
wife's name was Cassandra?

1089
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,819
Yeah, that's the story.

1090
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:52,380
He's trying to collect the
family he lost, you get it?

1091
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:56,389
Young son Billy, and the
teenage daughter Tiffany.

1092
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:57,820
Fuck me.

1093
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,870
I knew a Tiffany once,
she was smoking hot.

1094
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:01,969
She had these tits that were sticking out.

1095
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,219
- And the location of the RV?

1096
01:10:07,777 --> 01:10:09,280
Do you have any leads on where I am?

1097
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,112
Look.

1098
01:10:11,389 --> 01:10:13,270
I don't want you to give up hope, huh?

1099
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:16,120
You give up hope and that's
when you start thinking about...

1100
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,830
- Putting a bullet through my head?

1101
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:20,660
Well, you know what I mean.

1102
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,530
I'm still checking on the information.

1103
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:24,480
I'll find you, you gotta believe in me.

1104
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,780
- Thanks, Bullet.

1105
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:37,100
The only time you give up hope

1106
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,100
is when you're dead.

1107
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,850
Now stay strong, okay?

1108
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,343
Keep the faith, I'll talk to you later.

1109
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:50,773
- Okay.

1110
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,900
Okay.

1111
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,053
Turn off the radio and I'll
contact you at sunrise, okay?

1112
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:01,123
- Yeah, yeah, sunrise.

1113
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,862
Okay, so Bruce was in Special Forces.

1114
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,900
You've counseled a lot
of Special Forces types.

1115
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,850
Use what you know to find his weakness.

1116
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,690
He lost a wife and son
while he was a soldier.

1117
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,860
A young son and a teenage daughter.

1118
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,809
The perfect family.

1119
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,500
He thinks the army fucked him over

1120
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,350
by not protecting them, play to that.

1121
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:32,480
He might have his new wife

1122
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,620
but you can tell him
where to get the children.

1123
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,270
Play the role of the loving wife.

1124
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,112
The Lima Syndrome,

1125
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,770
where the abductor develops
sympathy for his hostage.

1126
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,719
- He's not smart enough to win,

1127
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,559
because he doesn't know me.

1128
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,350
I know every mind game there is to know.

1129
01:12:12,752 --> 01:12:13,919
I'm gonna win.

1130
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,603
You were absolutely brilliant, Frank,

1131
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,809
detailing how it was the army
who turned you into a rapist

1132
01:12:32,809 --> 01:12:34,333
if in fact you ever were one.

1133
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,740
I must admit, it was
one of my better ideas.

1134
01:12:40,264 --> 01:12:42,170
- What happens now?

1135
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:45,570
- Well now, you get a
dishonorable discharge,

1136
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,702
two years in a halfway house, and,

1137
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:52,670
we continue our counseling sessions.

1138
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:56,610
Congratulations, Frank, you're a free man.

1139
01:12:57,987 --> 01:12:58,820
- Free?

1140
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:01,782
What about what I've done?

1141
01:13:01,782 --> 01:13:03,563
What about the victims?

1142
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,750
- Well, a colleague of
mine who owed me a favor

1143
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:12,620
conducted the interviews
of the alleged victims.

1144
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:15,030
And, well I don't think the officers

1145
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:17,120
of the current marshal board
were particularly pleased

1146
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,780
to hear that the victims were,

1147
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,733
for a lack of clinical terms, whores.

1148
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,787
- But that doesn't make any sense.

1149
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,253
- Frank.

1150
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,633
You're free.

1151
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:39,820
And based on my observations,

1152
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,410
the local DA also agreed
that you will not be required

1153
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:45,593
to either report or
register as a sex offender.

1154
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:54,930
Now you can go out there
and get that daycare job.

1155
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,137
Just like you always dreamed about.

1156
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:02,084
- Really?

1157
01:14:04,337 --> 01:14:07,811
I'm really free?

1158
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:08,894
- Yes, Frank.

1159
01:14:11,568 --> 01:14:13,151
You're really free.

1160
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:17,543
- You know, I raped all those women.

1161
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,770
They weren't whores.

1162
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:22,050
But what I did to them,

1163
01:14:23,243 --> 01:14:27,093
that was nothing compared to
what I did to these children.

1164
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,454
Free?

1165
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:36,115
Maybe death will set me free.

1166
01:14:36,115 --> 01:14:36,948
- Frank, no!

1167
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,410
You're a trained psychologist.

1168
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:53,500
You have listened to sad stories

1169
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,760
from hundreds of crazy people.

1170
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,773
You can do this.

1171
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,200
Because you're much smarter.

1172
01:15:01,693 --> 01:15:02,527
Okay.

1173
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,823
- You were right, Doc.

1174
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,860
I just need to see how it felt

1175
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,306
and it felt fucking amazing.

1176
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:14,102
- You fucking bitch!

1177
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,116
You fucking bitch!

1178
01:15:25,116 --> 01:15:27,366
It will never fucking stop!

1179
01:15:33,282 --> 01:15:34,282
- Cassandra.

1180
01:15:38,308 --> 01:15:39,891
- Help me, help me.

1181
01:16:00,178 --> 01:16:01,011
- Mmm.

1182
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,159
Baby.

1183
01:16:07,217 --> 01:16:09,413
You've really outdone yourself.

1184
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:14,563
- Outdone myself?

1185
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:20,230
Well I guess that's my ultimate
duty in this life, right?

1186
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:21,993
To keep you completely satisfied.

1187
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,300
- No.

1188
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,066
No, that's not what I was saying.

1189
01:16:26,066 --> 01:16:27,816
Just, I loved dinner.

1190
01:16:30,592 --> 01:16:32,259
It was great.

1191
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:34,853
It's good.

1192
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,583
It's good.

1193
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,570
You were always a good cook, Cassandra.

1194
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,210
You should eat while it's hot.

1195
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:51,590
Unless you like eating those snacks.

1196
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:58,309
Did the kids behave today?

1197
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,063
- Oh, well, you know Billy,

1198
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:07,930
he's six and he thinks he
should be driving already.

1199
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:08,763
- Yeah.

1200
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,532
Yeah.

1201
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,487
- And Tiffany, well she wants a new dress.

1202
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:21,698
- Just like her mother.

1203
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:28,743
- So.

1204
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:31,763
You know, I've told you about my day.

1205
01:17:32,797 --> 01:17:34,860
About, well, Ms. Peterson

1206
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:41,110
asking me to prescribe her
husband Viagra, you know

1207
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:42,883
how that goes,

1208
01:17:42,883 --> 01:17:44,983
hopefully that never happens to us, but...

1209
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:49,797
Anyways, let's talk
about you for once, hm?

1210
01:17:50,785 --> 01:17:52,202
How was your day?

1211
01:17:54,582 --> 01:17:55,415
- Really?

1212
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:00,969
You know everything I do is classified.

1213
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:02,163
Do you really wanna risk me losing my job

1214
01:18:02,163 --> 01:18:03,993
just so we can bond over them?

1215
01:18:12,508 --> 01:18:17,508
The look on
your face right now.

1216
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,573
Bruce?

1217
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,090
I think after breakfast,

1218
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:25,040
we should take a drive like we used to.

1219
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:31,653
- We never took drives.

1220
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,350
You always got carsick.

1221
01:18:38,485 --> 01:18:40,320
You won't even go camping with me.

1222
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:46,653
You said that's for redneck hillbillies.

1223
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,073
- Really?

1224
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,813
I never know when you're joking or not.

1225
01:19:03,469 --> 01:19:07,020
It's like you're just trying to play some

1226
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,320
freaky mind games with me.

1227
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,032
Walking on eggshells, not
knowing if I'm gonna offend you

1228
01:19:13,032 --> 01:19:16,680
or if I'm gonna say the wrong thing

1229
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,330
and you're just gonna snap on me.

1230
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:26,403
- I think after breakfast, which
you did a wonderful job at,

1231
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,610
we need to go pick up Billy and Tiffany

1232
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:30,803
from my sister's.

1233
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:40,139
- Do you think I'm crazy?

1234
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:43,313
- No, of course, not.

1235
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:47,430
I'm just reminding you that

1236
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:51,593
Billy and Tiffany spent
the night at my sister's

1237
01:19:51,593 --> 01:19:53,143
and we need to go pick them up.

1238
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,653
- Tiffany was raped and gutted.

1239
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,973
Billy was hung from the kitchen light.

1240
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,223
They're both dead.

1241
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:16,763
What?

1242
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:20,493
- Look, Brian, you're a doctor, right?

1243
01:20:21,704 --> 01:20:23,980
And you treat the bodies of your clients.

1244
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,754
Sort of like how a mechanic
works on a vehicle.

1245
01:20:26,754 --> 01:20:27,833
A mechanic?

1246
01:20:28,809 --> 01:20:31,389
No, I'm much more qualified

1247
01:20:31,389 --> 01:20:34,280
and higher above a mechanic.
- Whereas I treat the minds

1248
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,500
of my clients.

1249
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,830
- My pay grade is-
- Okay?

1250
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:39,809
You can't see the mind.
- Skyrocketing fast.

1251
01:20:39,809 --> 01:20:41,430
- That makes diagnosis
a lot more difficult

1252
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,639
than checking to see
whether Mr. Peterson's dick

1253
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:44,678
is up or down.

1254
01:20:44,678 --> 01:20:46,610
It's hard, it's a trick.
- Okay, it's more complicated

1255
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,080
than just looking at a dick.

1256
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,782
- I have to know
everything about my client.

1257
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:56,063
See, this is my party.

1258
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:58,653
Not your party.

1259
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:02,553
We do what I wanna do, not you.

1260
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:05,389
You wanna play mind games?

1261
01:21:07,003 --> 01:21:08,643
Then I'll strip you naked,

1262
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:13,273
bend you over this table, and
fuck you with a broomstick.

1263
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,702
Best you eat this while it's hot.

1264
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,574
What you don't eat, I will toss.

1265
01:21:27,574 --> 01:21:28,594
- Right, right, right.

1266
01:21:28,594 --> 01:21:29,428
You're giving me
- Why don't you shut up you

1267
01:21:29,428 --> 01:21:30,261
might just learn something.
- Fucking anxiety!

1268
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:32,740
You're giving me anxiety.

1269
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:33,573
Please, can we?
- You should fucking shut up

1270
01:21:33,573 --> 01:21:34,406
you actually learn something.
- Can we have

1271
01:21:34,406 --> 01:21:35,405
a normal conversation for once?

1272
01:21:35,405 --> 01:21:36,237
- No you be quiet,

1273
01:21:36,237 --> 01:21:37,357
and you shut up.
- We'll just have fun.

1274
01:21:37,357 --> 01:21:41,100
- If you fucking shut up you
would actually learn something.

1275
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,950
What do you want?

1276
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:49,740
- I want to eat my breakfast in peace.

1277
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,353
Now eat.

1278
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,603
Or get fucked.

1279
01:21:59,853 --> 01:22:01,333
It don't make no difference to me.

1280
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:08,419
- You're so on edge all the time.

1281
01:22:08,419 --> 01:22:10,818
You're gonna make me blow
my fucking brains out.

1282
01:22:17,111 --> 01:22:20,693
- I wonder who would
be the worse for that?

1283
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:28,543
Excuse me, I need some air.

1284
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,990
- I'll have to blindfold you.

1285
01:22:40,549 --> 01:22:42,377
- Yeah that's okay, I just need some air.

1286
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,112
If I promise not to look,

1287
01:23:12,192 --> 01:23:13,791
will you take the blindfold off?

1288
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:19,490
- When I went to Kuwait,

1289
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:23,053
they promise me that my
family would be safe.

1290
01:23:27,059 --> 01:23:27,950
Promises are like

1291
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:30,702
toilet paper.

1292
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,850
It's nice when you need it.

1293
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:37,463
But when you wipe your ass,

1294
01:23:39,469 --> 01:23:41,112
the promise is covered in shit.

1295
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:47,469
And it's only good to flush

1296
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:49,202
along with all of the other shit.

1297
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,362
- Very visual example.

1298
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,753
Thank you so much for sharing.

1299
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,910
- I think you've had enough fresh air.

1300
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:04,743
Let's go.

1301
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,460
Please let me go.

1302
01:24:13,273 --> 01:24:14,107
- I can't.

1303
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:20,510
- I know where you can get a son

1304
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,353
and a daughter.

1305
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,210
And a much more beautiful wife.

1306
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:27,510
- More beautiful than you?

1307
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,553
- Yes, much more beautiful than me.

1308
01:24:35,414 --> 01:24:37,683
And she has a son and a daughter.

1309
01:24:39,536 --> 01:24:40,534
It's everything you want,

1310
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,143
it's everything you've
been trying to find.

1311
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:48,270
I can't have children.

1312
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:54,940
- What's her name?

1313
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:58,543
- Julie.

1314
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,719
I can give you her address.

1315
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:04,143
I can tell you how to get
to her and her children.

1316
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,397
- We'll see, maybe.

1317
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,050
- Yeah, that's it.

1318
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,430
Give him something to think about.

1319
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,309
Why go after the wife,
the son and daughter,

1320
01:25:45,309 --> 01:25:47,010
when you can get the whole family?

1321
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:57,340
Bullet.

1322
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,170
Kenny, Bullet, it's me, Tara.

1323
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:00,003
Are you there?

1324
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:03,490
I've been waiting all morning!

1325
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:07,309
- Sorry, Bruce came in
and brought me breakfast.

1326
01:26:07,309 --> 01:26:08,620
Nice, nice, terrific.

1327
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,452
I hope you enjoyed it.

1328
01:26:09,452 --> 01:26:10,969
Are you two planning a wedding?

1329
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,910
- Do you have any information?

1330
01:26:15,749 --> 01:26:17,700
Any news on where the RV might be?

1331
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,889
Please, anything, just
give me some good news.

1332
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,059
This is the bad news.

1333
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:23,540
Looking through the police reports,

1334
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,280
- Police reports?

1335
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,990
Yeah, listen, I
got a buddy on the inside.

1336
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,969
Seems as though that RV is
something of a community vehicle

1337
01:26:30,969 --> 01:26:33,433
for serial killers.

1338
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,880
Sorry, it's passed from one
serial killer to another.

1339
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:39,750
Not that I'm scaring ya,

1340
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,070
but if you believe in ghosts

1341
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,680
then your RV should be packed full of 'em

1342
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,360
'cause there's been a
lot of killings inside

1343
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,530
and a lot of,

1344
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:50,353
well you know, the stuff that
goes on before the killing.

1345
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,350
- So you can't track its location?

1346
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,870
That's a negative.

1347
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:57,130
You're in a field, right?

1348
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,467
Can you tell me something about it?

1349
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,020
- He took me outside earlier

1350
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,940
but I had something on my face.

1351
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:05,413
Jeez, are you that ugly?

1352
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
- Bullet, I couldn't see anything, okay?

1353
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,860
Did you smell anything?

1354
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,260
I don't know, like the smell of alfalfa,

1355
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:17,230
corn, pig shit, something else to help.

1356
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,513
Did you hear cows, maybe horses, anything?

1357
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:21,803
- Amaranth.

1358
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:24,643
I smelled Amaranth.

1359
01:27:25,809 --> 01:27:28,300
Everywhere I turned, I could smell that.

1360
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,653
Amaranth?

1361
01:27:29,653 --> 01:27:31,540
Well if you smelled it
from every direction

1362
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,603
then it could be a landscaper.

1363
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:35,870
Okay, anything else?

1364
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,719
Think, did you hear a train,

1365
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,333
maybe a airplane flew over.

1366
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,440
- Yes, yes, there was a airplane.

1367
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,840
When?

1368
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,070
- I don't know, 10 minutes ago.

1369
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:48,620
And it was loud, like a commercial jet.

1370
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:51,120
Okay, okay, this
is good, this is good.

1371
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,650
A landscape business that raises Amaranth

1372
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:56,993
and is in the flight
path of a commercial jet.

1373
01:27:58,222 --> 01:27:59,300
Think, use your head.

1374
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,900
What else did you hear or smell?

1375
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,010
- There were birds.

1376
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:08,670
Like they were high above me.

1377
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:11,103
But there were birds, lots of them.

1378
01:28:11,103 --> 01:28:13,440
Okay, okay,
okay, good, good, good.

1379
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,160
A field bordered by tall
trees, this is good.

1380
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,510
- Yeah, yeah, this is good.

1381
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,133
Bullet.

1382
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:28,463
Hey, Bullet.

1383
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:31,420
Are you not telling me something?

1384
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:32,253
What's going on?

1385
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,300
You really wanna know?

1386
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,460
- Yeah, yeah, tell me.

1387
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:44,139
The way all these
serial killers, like Bruce,

1388
01:28:44,139 --> 01:28:45,950
have been able to keep killing people

1389
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:48,380
is that they either hold their captive

1390
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:50,550
for a maximum of four days

1391
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:51,800
or they just move the RV.

1392
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,393
- Are you saying I don't have much time?

1393
01:28:56,732 --> 01:28:58,190
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1394
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:00,210
Don't get all girly on me, okay?

1395
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,680
I'll find you, don't worry about it.

1396
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,469
But if you think he's gonna move the RV,

1397
01:29:04,469 --> 01:29:07,273
you gotta let me know, okay, like ASAP.

1398
01:29:08,987 --> 01:29:09,821
Do you hear me?

1399
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:13,889
- Yes, I heard you.

1400
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:18,889
All right, Jesus,
okay let me do some checking.

1401
01:29:18,889 --> 01:29:19,723
I'll hit you up at sunset

1402
01:29:19,723 --> 01:29:21,523
so don't turn off the radio, okay?

1403
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:24,000
Just keep the faith,
it'll be okay, really.

1404
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:24,913
- Okay, Bullet.

1405
01:30:03,139 --> 01:30:06,660
- Captain, I don't want you
to take this personally.

1406
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,500
This is not a personal attack.

1407
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,200
- Yes sir, I-
- But there seems to be

1408
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,840
a pattern developing among the patients

1409
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,460
that you're treating.

1410
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:15,293
- Sir, I believe that-

1411
01:30:15,293 --> 01:30:16,243
- Let me finish.

1412
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:21,240
Now I fully acknowledge that

1413
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,740
since we began the war in Afghanistan,

1414
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:26,090
the number of suicides
among returning veterans

1415
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,433
has greatly increased.

1416
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,920
But Captain, the majority of the soldiers

1417
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:35,433
that you were treating,

1418
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:38,893
let me be blunt.

1419
01:30:41,059 --> 01:30:44,400
You are one of the few counselors we have

1420
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,000
that has a higher percentage

1421
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,500
of suicides among the men they're treating

1422
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,830
than non-suicides.

1423
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:53,050
- Colonel, sir, respectfully,

1424
01:30:53,050 --> 01:30:55,583
you cannot be saying that
I'm not being successful.

1425
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:01,190
I'm prepared to go through each
and every one of my patients

1426
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:03,280
and provide a thorough
detailed explanation

1427
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,980
for their psychological issues!

1428
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,927
All of which might I add,
were pre-existing conditions.

1429
01:31:06,927 --> 01:31:07,760
- I don't think that-

1430
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,030
- And in references to percentages,

1431
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,219
you might want to consider that

1432
01:31:10,219 --> 01:31:11,900
as opposed to other counselors,

1433
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,340
my caseload is predominantly
composed of operators

1434
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,130
in the Special Forces Unit.

1435
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:18,240
And being a member of
the Special Forces Unit

1436
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,032
I might suggest already
indicate psychological issues.

1437
01:31:22,272 --> 01:31:25,530
- If one more of your
patients commits suicide,

1438
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,710
I think it will be time for you

1439
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:28,530
to start considering other options.

1440
01:31:31,564 --> 01:31:32,523
- Other options, sir?

1441
01:31:32,523 --> 01:31:33,973
What other options?

1442
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,440
- You're young and you're talented.

1443
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,110
Get out of the military.

1444
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:41,570
Start a private practice, make some money.

1445
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:44,059
But I can't keep trying to explain

1446
01:31:44,059 --> 01:31:47,430
how 90% of the soldiers
that you're treating

1447
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:49,780
ends up committing suicide,

1448
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,980
or hurting other people.

1449
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,700
We're here to help them,

1450
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,344
not push them over the edge.

1451
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,512
Is that you, Tara?

1452
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:01,477
- Kenny, is that you?

1453
01:32:03,807 --> 01:32:04,865
- No.

1454
01:32:04,865 --> 01:32:06,865
My handle's Pill Popper.

1455
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,313
- What?

1456
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,750
Bullet asked
me to make some research

1457
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:15,253
and I think I've narrowed
down your location.

1458
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:18,730
- You know where I am?

1459
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:20,070
Yeah, but let me make sure

1460
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:21,957
that Bullet told me right.

1461
01:32:21,957 --> 01:32:24,340
You can smell Amaranth on all four sides.

1462
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,540
You're in a flight path,

1463
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,210
and you can hear birds in tall trees.

1464
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:29,577
Is that all right?

1465
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:32,680
- Yes, yes, that's right, that's right.

1466
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,862
This
actually makes more sense.

1467
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,660
- It makes sense?

1468
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:40,900
There's an
abandoned landscaping company

1469
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,270
called Chamber's Cherubs.

1470
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,250
They were one of the main
suppliers of Amaranth

1471
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,500
until they went bankrupt.

1472
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,400
They haven't been able
to sell the property

1473
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,003
because it's located on a new flight path.

1474
01:32:54,023 --> 01:32:55,666
- So you know where I am?

1475
01:32:55,666 --> 01:32:57,790
I'm
looking at the aerial photo

1476
01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:00,070
and there's a wide open field

1477
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,403
bordered by tall trees.

1478
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:05,710
Looks like an old RV parked in the middle.

1479
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:09,112
- That's me, that's me, that's me.

1480
01:33:09,112 --> 01:33:10,009
Call the cops please.

1481
01:33:10,009 --> 01:33:12,509
Please call the cops right now!

1482
01:33:12,509 --> 01:33:16,925
Darling,
I'd love to call the police.

1483
01:33:19,286 --> 01:33:21,934
See?

1484
01:33:21,934 --> 01:33:23,936
- Conspiracy nut jobs.

1485
01:33:23,936 --> 01:33:26,782
I'm dead.

1486
01:33:26,782 --> 01:33:28,478
- He's not gonna call the police,

1487
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:30,183
he's not gonna call the police.

1488
01:33:30,183 --> 01:33:33,750
He fucking knows where I am,
he won't call the police!

1489
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:37,250
Fucking idiots.

1490
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:41,260
Sorry, sorry, can you say that again?

1491
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,750
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that last part.

1492
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,519
Can you say again?

1493
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:46,300
Dead, I'm dead.

1494
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:58,059
Not even an innocent, unborn
baby wanted to come out of you.

1495
01:33:58,059 --> 01:33:59,773
Your baby killed herself.

1496
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,188
- The fuck?

1497
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:16,489
Everyone
you know, you've killed.

1498
01:34:16,489 --> 01:34:18,260
- You killed me.

1499
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,447
You killed me.

1500
01:34:24,846 --> 01:34:27,449
You
pushed them over the edge

1501
01:34:27,449 --> 01:34:29,449
playing your mind games.

1502
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:50,936
Do it!

1503
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:52,257
End the pain!

1504
01:34:52,257 --> 01:34:54,023
You'll be saving lives.

1505
01:36:12,582 --> 01:36:14,249
- What do you think?

1506
01:36:15,304 --> 01:36:18,200
- I think we just about
got our drug perfected,

1507
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,273
that's what I think.

1508
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:23,360
They keeping that same fucking name?

1509
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,804
- Yeah.

1510
01:36:24,804 --> 01:36:25,637
- Well.

1511
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,389
- People see what they wanna see.

1512
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,950
And then they create reality based

1513
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,503
on what they believe they see.

1514
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,660
- Well I gotta tell you.

1515
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,660
I really thought you blew your
fucking brains out out there.

1516
01:36:48,309 --> 01:36:50,227
- Is this drug working?

1517
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,023
- Yes, the drug is infallible.

1518
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,630
- I can't believe that she thought

1519
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:59,710
you were gonna actually marry her.

1520
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:01,423
That's unbelievable to me.

1521
01:37:02,809 --> 01:37:05,630
- Well, some people are too blind

1522
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:07,073
to see the true reality.

1523
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,233
She was never in an RV.

1524
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:12,833
Only chained in her mind.

1525
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:21,510
The drug blurs the lines between reality

1526
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:22,760
and the perception of it,

1527
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,362
allowing people to
inhabit false realities.

1528
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,630
I'm surprised it worked so well

1529
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:31,650
on a trained psychologist.

1530
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:33,290
Someone who is supposed to see

1531
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:34,833
through the lies of deception.

1532
01:37:50,263 --> 01:37:51,096
- Bruce!

1533
01:37:52,219 --> 01:37:53,563
De opresso de libre!

1534
01:37:57,017 --> 01:37:58,313
To free the opressed.

1535
01:38:02,299 --> 01:38:05,716
You know, the mind makes its own reality.

1536
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:09,740
Makes its own terror, yeah.

1537
01:38:14,817 --> 01:38:16,900
Plays almost like a game.

1538
01:38:21,639 --> 01:38:22,807
- A mind game.
